abstract = {This paper deals with an analytical method for magnetic field calculation in the air gap of cylindrical electrical machines including slotting effects. The analytical method is based on the resolution of the two-dimensional Laplace's equation in polar coordinates by the separation of variables technique. The originality of the proposed model is to take into account the mutual influence of slots on the air-gap magnetic field. The proposed method is sufficiently general to be used as a tool for air-gap magnetic field calculation of slotted electrical machines as reluctance or permanent magnet motors or actuators. Magnetic field and electromagnetic torque computed with the proposed analytical method are validated through finite-element analysis. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Then, structures with short pitch magnets are considered and compared with conventional ones.

abstract = {In the context of electricity shortage and an attempt to save the environment, introduction of energy efficient motors in different fields of application has become a necessity. This paves the way for fusing the conventional machine design procedures with optimization techniques. Unfortunately, the mathematics of electrical machine design involves calculations with highly nonlinear equation sets, and hence the conventional analytical optimization techniques do not fit well. In this study, design of an efficiency-optimized squirrel cage induction motor is considered, where genetic algorithm is chosen as the tool for optimization. The various constraints considered are selected on the basis of material, mechanical, and performance considerations as approved by standards and practices. The influence of change of materials and change of upper limit of customer's budget on different key motor design performance indicators are studied with and without cost constraints. Also, a systematic and statistics-based approach is proposed to achieve an optimized motor design, even at very low cost, provided relaxation of some constraints is allowed by the specific application. The optimized results are validated through tests on laboratory prototypes. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an adaptive proportional- integral-derivative (PID) speed control schemeforpermanentmag- net synchronous motor (PMSM) drives. The proposed controller consists of three control terms: a decoupling term, a PID term, and a supervisory term. The first control term is employed to compen- sate for the nonlinear factors, the second term is made to auto- matically adjust the control gains, and the third one is designed to guarantee the system stability. Different from the offline-tuning PID controllers, the proposed adaptive controller includes adap- tive tuning laws to online adjust the control gains based on the gradient descent method. Thus, it can adaptively deal with any system parameter uncertainties in reality. The proposed scheme is not only simple and easy to implement, but also it guarantees an accurate and fast speed tracking. It is proven that the con- trol system is asymptotically stable. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the comparative experiments between the proposed adaptive PID controller and the conventional PID con- troller are performed on the PMSM drive. Finally, it is validated that the proposed design scheme accomplishes the superior control performance (faster transient response and smaller steady-state er- ror) compared to the conventional PID method in the presence of parameter uncertainties.},

abstract = {Jet injection presents a promising alternative to needle and syringe injection for transdermal drug delivery. The controllability of recently-developed jet injection devices now allows jet speed to be modulated during delivery, and has enabled efficient and accurate delivery of volumes up to 0.3 mL. However, recent attempts to inject larger volumes of up to 1 mL using the same methods have highlighted the different requirements for successful delivery at these larger volumes. This study aims to establish the jet speed requirements for delivery of 1 mL of liquid using a controllable, voice coil driven injection device. Additionally, the effectiveness of a two-phase jet speed profile is explored (where jet speed is deliberately decreased toward the end of the injection) and compared to the constant jet speed case. A controllable jet injection device was developed to deliver volumes of 1 mL of liquid at jet speeds {\textgreater}140 m/s. This device was used to deliver a series of injections into post-mortem porcine tissue in single and two-phase jet speed profiles. Single-phase injections were performed over the range 80 m/s to 140 m/s. Consistent delivery success ({\textgreater}80{\%} of the liquid delivered) was observed at a jet speed of 130 m/s or greater. Consistent penetration into the muscle layer coincided with delivery success. Two-phase injections of 1 mL were performed with a first phase volume of 0.15 mL, delivered at 140 m/s, while the injection of the remainder of fluid was delivered at a second phase speed that was varied over the range 60 m/s to 120 m/s. Ten two-phase injections were performed with a second phase speed of 100 m/s producing a mean delivery volume of 0.8 mL ± 0.2 mL, while the single-phase injections at 100 m/s achieved a mean delivery volume of 0.4 mL ± 0.3 mL. These results demonstrate that a reduced jet speed can be used in the later stages of a 1 mL injection to achieve delivery success at a reduced energy cost. We found that a jet speed approaching 100 m/s was required following initial penetration to successfully deliver 1 mL, whereas speeds as low as 50 m/s have been used for volumes of {\textless}0.3 mL. These findings provide valuable insight into the effect of injection volume and speed on delivery success; this information is particularly useful for devices that have the ability to vary jet speed during drug delivery.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

A three-level DOE is performed to reach an optimum solution with minimum simulations. Finite element analysis is used to study the different effects. Two prototypes are being fabricated for experimental verification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Stoma-related complications and problems in stoma care are common after gastrointestinal surgery requiring the construction of a stoma. The frequency and types of such complications and problems were evaluated in a patient cohort operated on in Oulu University Hospital.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A detailed questionnaire concerning clinical problems and stoma care was mailed to 163 stoma patients operated on during the years from 1995 to 2001 in Oulu University Hospital. One hundred and nineteen patients (70 percent) answered the questions adequately. The clinical variables concerning stoma complications and the patients' symptoms, problems with stoma care and adaptation to the situation were recorded. Special attention was paid to the patients' general wellbeing and social problems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Thirty-five patients (30{\%}) had stoma complications, most commonly parastomal hernias (18 cases). Patients with an ileostomy had more difficulties with stoma handling more often than the patients with a colostomy. Seventy-eight patients (66{\%}) were well adapted to their stoma, including 49 (72{\%}) of the patients with a colostomy and 25 (56{\%}) of the patients with an ileostomy. Of the 41 non-adapted patients, 12 did not accept their altered body image, ten had problems in social life and nine had difficulties because of faecal leakage. The quality of life analysis of 114 patients showed that their physical condition was better than before the operation in 55 cases (48{\%}), unchanged in 16 (14{\%}) and worse in 43 (38{\%}). General mental health was better than before the operation in 52 cases (46{\%}), unchanged in 23 (20{\%}) and worse in 39 (34{\%}) patients. Social functioning had improved after stoma surgery in 38 cases (34{\%}), remained unchanged in 27 (24{\%}) and deteriorated in 46 (42{\%}) patients after stoma surgery. Patients with a colostomy reported worse subjective physical condition, mental health and social functioning than the patients with an ileostomy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of the patients had adapted to their stoma. The patients with an ileostomy had difficulties in stoma handling and the patients with a colostomy reported their physical, mental and social wellbeing to be affected.},

abstract = {The use of finite-element-method (FEM) simulation in electrical machine optimal design is affected by two main problems: the computation time in FEM simulations and the large number of parameters of the electrical machine. Here, we propose a surrogate model to use with electrical machines, based on statistical multiple correlation coefficients (R2) analysis and moving least squares (MLS) approximation. In the context of an optimization process, which needs a large number of evaluations strongly depending on the number of parameters, the computation effort is small compared to the time that can be saved. We validate this method by applying it to the optimal design of a synchronous machine. The results show that the torque per weight ratio improved by about 13{\%} in comparison with that obtained by classical optimization methods.},

The aim of SM is to achieve a satisfactory solution with a minimal number of computationally expensive "fine" model evaluations. SM procedures iteratively update and optimize surrogates based on a fast physically based "coarse" model. Proposed approaches to SM-based optimization include the original algorithm, the Broyden-based aggressive SM algorithm, various trust-region approaches, neural SM, and implicit SM. Parameter extraction is an essential SM subproblem. It is used to align the surrogate (enhanced coarse model) with the fine model. Different approaches to enhance uniqueness are suggested, including the recent gradient parameter-extraction approach. Novel physical illustrations are presented, including the cheese-cutting and wedge-cutting problems. Significant practical applications are reviewed.},

Because the phase windings and permanent magnets in FSPM machines are both located on the stator, the torque production mechanism is not the same as for a conventional PM synchronous machine. Spatial harmonic analysis is applied to examine the frequency components present in the electric loading and magnetic loading of the machine. Since torque is proportional to the product of the electric and magnetic loading, understanding the source of the principal harmonics in these waveforms yields powerful insights into the components that result in torque production. The analysis is first presented for a specific FSPM machine (12-slot, 10-pole) and then extended to a general FSPM machine. The primary torque-producing harmonics in the airgap flux density waveform are found to be the heterodyned harmonics of the MMF produced by the stator magnets and the airgap permeance seen by the stator looking into the rotor. Analytical results are compared to results from finite element (FE) analysis and exhibit good agreement.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 European Union. Modeling the 3-D flux patterns within Transverse Flux Machines (TFM) is one of the main challenges during their design. The analysis and design are often based on 3-D Finite Element Methods (FEM). Analytical models of TFMs are mostly limited to Magnetic Equivalent Circuits (MEC). This paper uses an analytical magnetic charge model to calculate the 3-D flux density in the air gap. An iterative approach allows for the modeling of flux focussing, resulting in a semi-analytical solution. Including flux focussing in the magnetic charge model results in a highly accurate prediction of the magnetic flux density in the air gap with less than 10{\%} error. Furthermore, the cogging and attraction force of the machine are calculated for four topologies.},

abstract = {In general transverse flux machines (TFM) are considered to be complex and difficult to manufacture. However, there are some exceptions. In the linear TFM the flux plane is the same as for the conventional rotating electrical machine. Therefore, iron laminations from conventional rotating machines can be used to manufacture the stator. The manufacturing process of the stator becomes then more simple compared to the manufacturing process of the conventional linear machine. This paper deals with a novel design of a linear TFM machine for the free piston energy converter application. It describes earlier designed and manufactured prototypes and a new manufacturing approach in order to avoid the loss in flux and thereby also loss in the force production.},

The TFM has a modular structure with quasi-U stator cores and ring windings. The rotor is constructed with ferrite magnets in a flux-concentrating arrangement to achieve high air gap flux density. The design considerations for this TFM with respect to initial sizing, pole number selection, key design ratios, and pole shaping are presented in this paper. Pole number selection is critical in the design process of a TFM because it affects both the torque density and power factor under fixed magnetic and changing electrical loading. Several key design ratios are introduced to facilitate the design procedure. The effect of pole shaping on back-emf and inductance is also analyzed. These investigations provide guidance toward the required design of a TFM for direct-drive applications. The analyses are carried out using analytical and three-dimensional finite element analysis. A prototype is under construction for experimental verification.},

The switching frequency is continually driven to megahertz range with GaN devices due to their small switching loss and driving loss, which greatly reduces the size of the passive components. The coupled inductor further reduces the core volume due to certain dc flux reductions. The equivalent inductance and the impact of the inverse coupled inductor on the CRM buck-boost converter are analyzed in detail. The resonant period in CRM is less with an inverse coupled inductor than with a noncoupled inductor, which is beneficial for the high-frequency operation. The soft-switching range and the circulating energy are both improved using an inverse coupled inductor in CRM. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis, and the coupled inductor prototype efficiency is 98.5{\%} at 1 MHz, which is 0.3{\%} higher than a prototype with a noncoupled inductor.},

abstract = {—DC-DC converter in electric vehicle (EV) has higher demand for high efficiency and power density. Faster switching is beneficial to high power density. Gallium nitride (GaN) power transistors have the advantages of faster switching capability, smaller parasitic parameters and better electric parameters, which make them more suitable to achieve higher switching frequency and power density in DC-DC converter in EV. In this paper, the two-staged converter consisting of Buck and multi-phase interleaved half-bridge LLC series resonant converter (LLC-SRC) is chosen as the main topology. The current sharing problem caused by the mismatch between resonant components is analyzed and improved. Design consideration of driver of low-voltage GaN transistor and the efficiency improvement of high-voltage GaN transistor in LLC- SRC are analyzed. A 1MHz/2kW, 330V/12V DC-DC converter prototype is fabricated and efficiency comparison experiment with Si MOSFET is finished. Experimental results show that GaN power transistor has superior high frequency switching capability and efficiency advantage compared to Si MOSFET.},

@article{Khaligh2010,
abstract = {The fuel economy and all-electric range (AER) of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are highly dependent on the on- board energy-storage system (ESS) of the vehicle. Energy-storage devices charge during low power demands and discharge during high power demands, acting as catalysts to provide energy boost. Batteries are the primary energy-storage devices in ground vehi- cles. Increasing the AER of vehicles by 15{\%} almost doubles the incremental cost of the ESS. This is due to the fact that the ESS of HEVs requires higher peak power while preserving high energy density. Ultracapacitors (UCs) are the options with higher power densities in comparison with batteries. A hybrid ESS composed of batteries, UCs, and/or fuel cells (FCs) could be a more appropriate option for advanced hybrid vehicular ESSs. This paper presents state-of-the-art energy-storage topologies for HEVs and plug-in HEVs (PHEVs). Battery, UC, and FC technologies are discussed and compared in this paper. In addition, various hybrid ESSs that combine two or more storage devices are addressed},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015.The interconnection of basic switching converters to increase power handling capabilities in dc applications has been widely reported in technical literature. This study presents a family of switching step-up dc-dc converters based on the principle of reduced redundant power processing (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}P{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). This principle states that the power transfer from input port and output port on interconnected converters is reduced when a non-cascading connection is used. As shown in this study, the principle R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}P{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} is useful for developing new converters. These have wide conversion ratios and quadratic dependence with respect to the duty ratio. In this study, the voltage conversion ratios, average models and steadystate operating conditions for proposed converters are derived, which are verified by experimental results.},

The power-stage design methodology and the operation of the designed power stage used to achieve high efficiency are described in detail. To operate the designed converter as a truck APU, the mode transfer control scheme, where smooth transitions of the voltage and current control modes are necessary, is proposed, and the current controller design procedure is described. A 5-kW four-phase dc-dc converter prototype is built with the proposed power-stage configuration, and the proposed control strategy is applied to control the dc-dc converter. The efficiency of the converter is more than 99.5{\%} at near 10{\%} load and above 98{\%} from 10{\%} to 100{\%} load range.

The stability issue is investigated in this paper, and design considerations and limitations of the methods that stabilize the open-loop converters are presented. By stabilizing the open-loop converter, it is shown that the feedback loop design is usually translated into a conventional feedback design task. The behavior of the unstable converter is also discussed, and a method for decreasing the amplitude of the output voltage oscillations is proposed. The model of a tightly regulated practical converter is presented. This model is used to decide how much damping should be added to make the feeder converter stable. Furthermore, because we have this information about the load converter, the feeder converter can be redesigned so that it does not see the load converter as a constant power load.},

abstract = {Tightly regulated closed-loop converters are problematic when used as a load since they tend to draw constant power and exhibit negative incremental resistance. This negative resistance causes stability problems for the feeder system, whether it is an input filter or another converter. In multiconverter power electronic systems, which exist in different land, sea, air, and space vehicles, including electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles, there are many converters loaded by other converters. Therefore, the destabilizing effect of the load converters, which are called constant-power loads, is a major issue. In this paper, a novel nonlinear feedback, which is called loop cancellation, is introduced. This technique is used to cancel the destabilizing effect of the constant-power loads. Theoretically, any amount of constant-power load can be compensated by this technique, and it can identically be implemented on different types of converters. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been verified by PSpice simulations and experimental results.},

abstract = {There is an emerging application, which uses a mixture of batteries within an energy storage system. These hybrid battery solutions may contain different battery types. A dc-side cascaded boost converters along with a module-based distributed power sharing strategy has been proposed to cope with variations in battery parameters such as, state-of-charge (SOC) and/or capacity. This power sharing strategy distributes the total power among the different battery modules according to these battery parameters. Each module controller consists of an outer voltage-loop with an inner current-loop where the desired control reference for each control-loop needs to be dynamically varied according to battery parameters to undertake this sharing. As a result, the designed control bandwidth (BW) or stability margin of each module control-loop may vary in a wide range, which can cause a stability problem within the cascaded converter. This paper reports such a unique issue and thoroughly investigates the stability of the modular converter under the distributed sharing scheme. The paper shows that a cascaded PI control-loop approach cannot guarantee the system stability throughout the operating conditions. A detailed analysis of the stability issue and the limitations of the conventional approach are highlighted. Finally in-depth experimental results are presented to prove the stability issue using a modular hybrid battery energy storage system prototype under various operating conditions.},

The proposed converter can achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) of all switches in continuous current mode (CCM) under bidirectional power flow. Even though step-up/down ratio is about 3.5 times compared to the conventional half bridge converter, the voltage rating of components such as switches and passive devices is about one-fourth of high voltage side (HVS) voltage. Also, since power flow is controlled only by the phase shift angle, the operation of the forward and backward modes becomes symmetrical, thereby making power flow change seamless without any complex control. The duty cycle is used to equalize voltages of capacitors of high voltage side (HVS), thereby making the voltage ratings of components exactly same and ensuring soft-switching of switches under wide voltage and load range. A 2 kW prototype is implemented and tested to verify validity of the proposed converter.},

abstract = {Several well-known analytical techniques exist for the force profile analysis of permanent-magnet linear synchronous motors. These techniques, however, make significant simplifications in order to obtain the magnetic field distribution in the air gap. From the field distribution, the force profile can be found. These widely used techniques provide a reasonable approximation for force profile analysis, but fail to give really accurate results in the sense of the exact shape of the force profile caused by effects that due to simplification are not fully included. To obtain the exact shape for the force profile in these cases, the computationally expensive finite-element method (FEM) is often applied. In this paper, an elegant semianalytical approach is presented to acquire the force profile. First, the magnetic field distribution in the air gap is determined by means of Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) mapping. The SC mapping allows a slotted structure of the machine to be mapped to a geometrically simpler domain for which analytic solutions are available. Subsequently, the field solution in the slotted structure can be determined by applying the mapping function to the field distribution in the simplified domain. From the resulting field distribution, the force profile is calculated by means of the Maxwell stress tensor. The results are compared with those from the commonly used equivalent magnetic circuit modeling and 2-D FEM software to demonstrate the accuracy which can be reached by application of the SC method.},

abstract = {This paper presents three types of magnetostatic models of ironless planar actuators with moving magnets. The models predict the force and torque exerted on the translator of the actuator, which can be positioned in six degrees-of-freedom with respect to the stator coils. The force and torque are calculated with the Lorentz force law. The analytical and numerical models can be used for the design of large planar actuators, for the fast comparison of actuator topologies, and in the decoupling and commutation algorithm. The models have been verified with experiments.},

The measurement method is applied to determine the magnetic hysteresis in the force of an E-core reluctance actuator, with and without pre-biasing permanent magnet. The force measurements are conducted with a piezoelectric load cell (Kistler type 9272). This high-bandwidth force measurement instrument is identified in the frequency domain using a voice-coil actuator that has negligible magnetic hysteresis and eddy currents. Specifically, the phase delay between the current and force of the voice-coil actuator is used for the calibration of the measurement instrument. This phase delay is also obtained by evaluation of the measured force and flux variation in the E-core actuator, both with and without permanent magnet on the middle tooth. The measured magnetic flux variation is used to distinguish the phase delay due to magnetic hysteresis from the measured phase delay between the current and the force of the E-core actuator. Finally, an open loop steady-state ac model is presented that predicts the magnetic hysteresis effects in the force of the E-core actuator.},

abstract = {Weight limitations in electric/hybrid cars demand the highest possible power-to-weight ratio from the traction motor, as in double salient permanent magnet (PM) machines. Their high flux densities in the air gap result in nonlinear analytical models, which need to be time optimized. The incorporated reluctance networks are sensitive to the correctness of air gap permeances. Conventionally, in these networks, air gap permeances are calculated by approximating flux paths; however, it is time inefficient. For an improved simulation time, spatial discretization techniques are presented to calculate air gap permeances in double salient PM machines. The spatial techniques discussed here cover the tooth contour method and Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) mapping as semidiscrete methods, which are used to discretize only the air gap region. Their results are verified by the spatial discrete method and finite element method, which discretizes the whole machine geometry. For consistency in this paper, all methods are explained on a three-phase 12/10 flux-switching PM motor. Obtained air gap permeances show a very good agreement with only 0.8{\%} difference. Further on, machine characteristics such as phase flux linkage and cogging torque are also compared to show the impact of the modeling techniques. The total machine simulation time is improved by 20{\%} using the SC method. Although methods are explained particularly for double salient PM machines, formulas are generalizable for other machine types as well.},

abstract = {The ever increasing necessity to improve torque density while simultaneously maintaining high efficiency is a constant point of concern for electrical machine designers. This is mainly driven by the need for direct-drive solutions in evermore applications. This paper presents a general mesh-free description of the magnetic field distribution in multiple air-gap electromagnetic machines, although the tool is also useful for single air-gap machines, actuators, and other magnetic devices. The used method is based on transfer relations and Fourier theory, which can provide the magnetic field solution for a wide class of 2-D boundary value problems. This technique is in this paper applied to the rotary multiple air-gap machine with slotless (without slots but with and without rotor back-iron) armature. The presented analysis is compared to finite-element analysis for the multiple-layer winding, which shows the applicability of this method for future optimization. It is shown that multiple air-gap machines make better use of the volume and for short axial lengths where a single-side bearing configuration can be utilized provides a means to improve the achievable torque density.},

As a result, high-performance vibration isolation and magnetic bearings based on permanent magnets are increasingly considered. This paper proposes improved analytical expressions for the torque on cuboidal permanent magnets applied to a magnetic bearing. These novel expressions are valid for any relative magnet position, especially when surfaces of the different magnets are in the same plane. Further, the torque can be obtained with respect to any reference point. Although these equations seem rather complicated, they enable an extremely fast and accurate calculation of the torque on a permanent magnet in the presence of a magnetic field of another permanent magnet.

The magnets create a passive attraction force for failsafe operation, which can be controlled for magnetically suspending the armature. Decoupling of the attraction and translational force, however, is complex, because they are strongly coupled. Therefore, position and current dependent force models are created based on curve fitting of inductances.

abstract = {Many modern advanced electromagnetic devices, e.g. motors and actuators, use permanent magnets as a source of magnetic fields. The strong and reliable magnetic fields of today's rare-earth permanent magnets increase their force density. Most of them are based on the interaction between the magnetic field of permanent magnets and current-carrying coils. However, magnetic couplings or electromagnetic vibration isolation systems rely on the strong and position-dependent passive force between permanent magnets instead of an active force resulting from a current. An accurate, noise-free computational description of these interactions is therefore essential for future developments of these high-performance devices. The considered configurations are free-space unbounded problems and do not exhibit structural periodicity. As a three-dimensional magnetic field solution is required, the analytical surface charge method is the model of choice. The expressions for the interaction force between PMs with an (anti-)parallel, perpendicular, and rotated magnetization are derived considering a configuration with two PMs. These could be extended to include various other electromagnetic device structures. Further, the developments in the analytical surface charge expressions of the interaction forces between cuboidal permanent magnets are addressed. Finally, extensions to the surface charge method are proposed, aiming to create a fully 6-DoF permanent magnet interaction model, which can serve as a fast, analytical replacement to the finite element method.},

These constraints are mainly the consequence of the relatively large effective magnetic airgap which limits the achievable magnetic loading and, therefore, the torque density of slotless permanent-magnet rotary actuators. Further, the miniaturization has to be achieved at ever-decreasing costs and, therefore, it would be advantageous to implement solid back irons. However this, even at reduced magnetic loading, still results in considerable eddy-current losses. Therefore, a careful selection of the various actuator dimensions and most appropriate soft magnetic laminated or solid material is a prerequisite for applications that require smooth speed and torque characteristic. This paper will identify the influence of various parameters of the slotless permanent-magnet actuator on the eddy-current loss in the back iron using both 2-D and 3-D finite-element analysis.},

abstract = {In Part I of the paper, we derive a semianalytical framework for the magnetic field calculation in the air gap of a tubular permanent-magnet (PM) actuator. We also make an extension for skewed topologies. However, the slotting effect and its related cogging force cannot be determined in a straightforward way. Therefore, in Part II, we apply the Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) conformal mapping method to one pole-pair of the tubular PM actuator. This mapping allows for field calculation in a domain where standard field solutions can be used. In this way, slotting effects can be taken into account; however, skewing cannot be implemented directly. The SC-conformal mapping method is valid only for two-dimensional Cartesian domains. We therefore apply a special transformation from the cylindrical to the Cartesian coordinate system to describe the tubular actuator as a linear actuator.},

More specifically, the square shaped magnets are replaced by trapezoidal shaped magnets. A semi-analytical magnetic field solution of regular square shaped magnets is presented and used to approximate the airgap field produced by the trapezoidal shaped PMs. The method is based on dividing the magnets into several radial layers and superposition of the fields to calculate the total magnetic field. The results are compared to finite element analysis (FEA) and show excellent agreement. Using this magnetic field solution, the effect of the shape of the magnets on the magnetic field waveform is analyzed by means of a parametric search.},

abstract = {IEEE Jet injection is a process by which a fluid drug is delivered through the skin in the form of a high-velocity jet. Powering jet injection using a controllable actuator, such as a moving-coil permanent magnet motor, offers many advantages, but to date has required large and heavy injection systems to provide the required power and control bandwidth. In order to minimize the size of the injection system, we developed a scaling model for jet injection systems powered by permanent magnet motors, giving the optimal actuator mass as a function of jet velocity, injection volume, motor efficiency, and energy storage density. We combined this model with an existing electromagnetic model to confirm the predicted scaling relationships and find optimal actuator designs. On this basis, we designed an injection system for 50 {\&} {\#}x03BC;L volumes, including a compact power amplifier and control system, and verified its performance by performing injections into pig skin. The total mass of the injector system was 578 g, with a 178 g handpiece. This model illustrates fundamental relationships that govern the design of any jet-production device powered by linear electric motors, for jet injection or other applications.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel transverse flux motor (TFM) which can significantly reduce the volume of the permanent magnets compared to conventional TFMs. To speed up the design process, an analytical technique based on a simplified two-dimensional model is developed to estimate the flux density and determine suitable parameters. The finite element analysis is then employed to refine the calculations and validate the analytical design. Excellent agreement between the simulation and experimental result shows that the proposed wheel motor design is suitable for direct-drive applications such as light electric vehicles.},

abstract = {Transverse-flux motors are easy to design for multipole structures without complicated winding geometry, and therefore, are suitable for high-torque generation. However, most of them employ surface-mounted or flux-concentrated permanent-magnet rotors, the magnets of which are placed on flux paths resulting from the coil excitation. This results in low permeance for the coil-excited magnetomotive force and many magnets on the rotor. To solve the problems, we designed a consequent-pole motor capable of generating almost the same torque with high permeance and half the amount of the magnets compared with conventional motors, so far. However, the motor also has a large cogging torque. This paper presents the fundamental design of a novel transverse-flux motor with small cogging torque by short circuit of the rotor-magnet flux inside the rotor only under unloaded condition and numerical-analysis verification of the drive principle. The analysis results indicate that the proposed motor can generate larger torque for the same current condition and 32{\&}{\#}x00D7; less cogging torque than the previously designed consequent-pole transverse-flux motor.},

abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to explore the theory of power factor in variable reluctance permanent magnet (VRPM) machines and to understand what physical features of these machines tend to cause the low value. A single figure of merit, for a given design, is identified that effectively determines what the best available working power factor may be. The same figure of merit is applicable to synchronous machines of conventional configuration, so that comparison can be made between VRPM and conventional machines and the fundamental reasons for their difference in working power factor understood. The scope for power factor improvement in VRPM machines can then be examined, by changing the electromagnetic design so as to modify the figure of merit appropriately. However, it will become clear that a very limited amount of improvement is possible, and low working power factor seems to be the price that must be paid for the high specific output},

Inspite of these fmt steps it took even more than 20 years to fmd a growing interest in machine engineering to understand the advantages of linear drives. Last but not least the power electronics helped to melt the ice.

A prototype of the designed actuator is built and coupled with a Simulink dSpace system to perform extensive measurements in order to validate the models and investigate the achievable acceleration within a predetermined motion profile. The electromotive force is measured, and the disturbance forces are identified. The position error is measured during the motion profile with an acceleration of 20 g and a stroke of 30 mm. Furthermore, thermal measurements are performed to check the achievable duty cycle. The built design shows good agreementwith themodels,},

In this paper, we propose a new PMLM having a 9-pole 10-slot structure in order to reduce the cogging force. Our PMLM is properly wound for three-phase driving. Through a theoretical and finite-element analysis, we show that the 9-pole 10-slot PMLM removes almost all of the cogging force while giving 10{\%} and 23{\%} larger back-electromotive force and thrust force, respectively, than a conventional 8-pole 12-slot PMLM under the same conditions of exciting current, total number of windings, and total PM volume.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new tubular permanent-magnet linear machine with square-shaped cross section and derive its corresponding analytical model by solving Maxwell equations and applying the superposition theorem. The analytical field solution is necessary for obtaining an analytic form of the machine parameters and variables such as the self- and mutual inductances of the windings, the thrust force, and the windings electromotive force (EMF). These provide a valuable tool for tubular machine analysis, design, and optimization. In order to achieve maximum force density, we optimized the design parameters of the proposed machine using the analytical model. We used finite-element analysis and experimental results to demonstrate the validity of the developed analytical model. Again using the Fourier series of the cogging force and its harmonic analysis, in this paper, we introduce two techniques for cogging force reduction in the new tubular linear permanent-magnet machine. The first technique reduces the cogging force due to interaction between the permanent magnets and the stator teeth, and the other reduces the cogging force due to finite length of the armature. These techniques are straightforward, and their implementations in the tubular linear permanent magnet machine with square cross section are easy. We investigated the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in cogging force reduction by 3-D finite-element analysis and experimental measurements.},

On the other hand, a multilayer perceptron feedforward network (trained by a backpropagation algorithm) that works as a hysteresis band comparator is used.

From these magnetic fields, device quantities, e.g., force, emf, or inductance, can be calculated. This paper presents a semianalytical technique, based on a 2-D Fourier series to represent the magnetic field, to describe the force components due to permanent magnets in 3-D cylindrical structures. The Maxwell stress tensor method is selected to calculate these force components in the cylindrical coordinate system. The method is analytically evaluated by inserting the analytical expressions describing the magnetic fields. The obtained force equations avoid the use of numerical integration of the magnetic fields resulting in a fast and accurate force calculation method. An example of a 3-D cylindrical structure is modeled and validated by means of a magnetostatic finite element analysis (FEA), and excellent agreement is found.},

abstract = {The thrust ripples in permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) are mainly generated by the distortion of the stator flux linkage distribution, reluctance force due to the relative position between the mover and stator, cogging force caused by the interaction between the permanent magnet (PM) and the iron core, and the end effects. This is the significant drawback which will deteriorate the performance of the drive system in high-precision applications. Comparing the complexity of the motor structure design to eliminate the thrust ripples, an optimal control method is more desirable. This paper focuses on thrust ripples reduction based on the predictive control algorithm. To minimize the thrust ripples and realize the high-precision control, the components of thrust ripples are extracted by finite element method (FEM) first and then compensated by injecting the instantaneous current to counteract the thrust ripples using the field-oriented control (FOC) method. The effectiveness of this proposed method is verified by the simulation using Simulink/Matlab according to the comparison between the compensation and noncompensation cases},

In contrast to the existing literature, the proposed model does not require the assumption of infinite tooth permeability, material property homogenization, or a hybrid modeling approach. In fact, the permeability variation in the slotted machine parts is embedded directly into the magnetostatic field solution. Currently, only linear soft-magnetic materials with finite permeability are considered. However, non-linear materials could be considered iteratively, and therefore the proposed model presents a first step toward including the magnetic saturation effects into HM. To validate the presented method, semi-analytical models are implemented for two benchmark topologies with slotted rotors. Magnetic field calculations are performed for two different values of linear rotor tooth permeability and compared to finite-element analysis predictions. The results show that a very good agreement is obtained.},

The analytical field solutions enable the resultant cogging force associated with the finite length of the armature to be determined as a function of the armature displacement, for both radially and Halbach magnetized stators.

abstract = {The thrust ripples in permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) are mainly generated by the distortion of the stator flux linkage distribution, reluctance force due to the relative position between the mover and stator, cogging force caused by the interaction between the permanent magnet (PM) and the iron core, and the end effects. This is the significant drawback which will deteriorate the performance of the drive system in high-precision applications. Comparing the complexity of the motor structure design to eliminate the thrust ripples, an optimal control method is more desirable. This paper focuses on thrust ripples reduction based on the predictive control algorithm. To minimize the thrust ripples and realize the high-precision control, the components of thrust ripples are extracted by finite element method (FEM) first and then compensated by injecting the instantaneous current to counteract the thrust ripples using the field-oriented control (FOC) method. The effectiveness of this proposed method is verified by the simulation using Simulink/Matlab according to the comparison between the compensation and noncompensation cases},

abstract = {The issue of whether environmental contaminants are inducing adverse health effects in humans and wildlife via interaction with endocrine systems has gained increasing interest during the 1990s. Endocrine disruption is one of the highest priority research topics for the US EPA, and a detailed research strategy has been developed to guide the placement of resources over the next several years. To address the deficiency of testing guidelines in detecting and characterizing damage mediated by interaction with the endocrine system, EPA has issued new multi generation testing guidelines. The new endpoints for monitoring pubertal development, semen quality, and estrous cyclicity will better enable determination of the affected sex, target organ, and life stage following exposure throughout the life cycle. Another major area of effort within EPA is the development of an endocrine disruptor screening program in response to passage of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. The current status of these efforts is described. On the federal level, endocrine disruption is one of the five priority research areas for the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources (CENR) within the Executive Office of President. The CENR has developed a framework to assess research needs for endocrine disruptors, inventoried existing efforts of the federal government (nearly 400 projects were identified as active in FY96), and prioritized additional research needs based upon the needs and gaps in current efforts. It is clear that a great deal of research is underway to clarify the validity of the endocrine disruptor hypothesis and to determine the breadth of chemicals that pose a risk to the endocrine system. The degree of forward research planning and coordination across many organizations should ensure that sufficient data will be available within the next few years to allow a rigorous weight of evidence evaluation that is needed to bring together diverse types of information to make informed decisions regarding risks to humans and wildlife.},

abstract = {Smooth motion is critical to some robotic applications such as haptics or those requiring high precision force control. These systems are often direct-drive, so any torque ripple in the motor output must be minimal. Unfortunately, low inherent torque ripple motors are expensive. Low cost brushless DC motors are becoming more prevalent, especially from the hobby RC community. These motors often have the required high torque density; however, they also have significant torque ripple. This paper presents a system that is low cost using a method for anticogging - the compensation of cogging torque in low cost, high torque motors. While other methods exist to compensate for current-based torque ripple (mutual or reluctance torque), none have addressed cogging torque, except by adding expensive force sensors. This paper presents two methods that use a position sensor (already present for servo motors) to map cogging torque to rotor position. The map is played back according to position reported from the sensor to cancel the cogging torque. The design and testing of a low cost haptic arm using anticogging shows validation; however, the approach is much broader, and can be applied to any precision force application. Test results on eleven different motors show an average removal of 69{\%} of torque ripple with no added cost in robotic servo applications.},

For this purpose, an improved magnetic equivalent circuit for calculation of the teeth and yoke flux densities in the LPMSMs is presented. The magnetic saturation of iron core is considered by nonlinear elements and an iterative procedure is used to update these elements. The armature reaction is also taken into account in the modeling by flux sources located on the teeth of motors. These sources are time dependent and can model every winding configuration. The relative motion between the motor primary and secondary is considered by wisely designing air gap elements simplifying the permeance network construction and preventing permeance matrix distortion during primary motion. Flux densities in different load conditions are calculated by means of the proposed model. The effects of saturation and armature reaction on the flux density distribution are shown in detail. Using these flux densities, iron losses in the motor are examined and its variations versus motor parameters are then studied. All results obtained by proposed model are verified by finite-element method based on an extensive analysis.},

abstract = {We present analytical and numerical methods for determining the magnetic field distribution in a tubular permanent-magnet actuator (TPMA). In Part I, we present the semianalytical method. This method has the advantage of a relatively short computation time and it gives physical insight. We make an extension for skewed topologies, which offer the benefit of reducing the large force ripples of the TPMA. However, a lot of assumptions and simplifications with respect to the slotted structure have to be made in order to come to a relatively simple semianalytical description. To model the slotting effect and the related cogging force, we apply a Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) mapping for magnetic field and force calculations in Part II of the paper. Validation of the models is done with finite-element analysis.},

Currently, there is an increase of voltage and current harmonics in power systems, caused by nonlinear loads. The active power filters (APFs) are used to compensate the generated harmonics and to correct the load power factor. The proposed control design is a pulse width modulation control (PWM) with two blocks that include neural networks. Adaptive networks estimate the reference compensation currents. On the other hand, a multilayer perceptron feedforward network (trained by a backpropagation algorithm) that works as a hysteresis band comparator is used. Two practical cases with Matlab-Simulink are presented to check the proposed control performance.},

In addition to permanent-magnet machines, this technique can be applied to any 2-D geometry with the restriction that the geometry should consist of rectangular regions.

abstract = {Needle-free jet injections constitute an important method of drug delivery, especially for insulin and vaccines. This report addresses the mechanisms of interactions of liquid jets with skin. Liquid jets first puncture the skin to form a hole through which the fluid is deposited into skin. Experimental studies showed that the depth of the hole significantly affects drug delivery by jet injections. At a constant jet exit velocity and nozzle diameter, the hole depth increased with increasing jet volume up to an asymptotic value and decreased with increasing values of skin's uniaxial Young's modulus. A theoretical model was developed to predict the hole depth as a function of jet and skin properties. A simplified model was first verified with polyacrylamide gels, a soft material in which the fluid mechanics during hole formation is well understood. Prediction of the hole depth in the skin is a first step in quantitatively predicting drug delivery by jet injection. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Pokharel2014,
abstract = {Why do some locally based institutions for using and managing shared resources survive, adapt and continue to perform well in the face of changing circumstances while others decline and disappear? To answer this, I revisited 233 irrigation canals in Nepal, originally used to illustrate the Common Pool Resource Framework, between 16 and 37 years later. The resulting longitudinal dataset with 509 variables, plus 39 randomly selected cases called for a different explanation of why only some of these paradigmatic institutions sustained cooperation over decades of rapid and multidimensional changes to keep their canals functional. Analyzing 827 interviews with canal users revealed a difference between the reasons of one considering committing to an institution, and one considering whether to change their existing commitment. Focusing on the latter revealed two variables relating to institutional performance over time: how fair the users perceive the institution to be, and how flexibly the rules are applied. Furthermore, the relevance of perceived fairness relates to government assistance; flexibility is bounded by the resource's technical needs; and the relationship of flexibility to institutional performance depends on perceived fairness. These patterns appear in the original data, the newly collected data, and in the changes between the two. The resulting theory of sustained cooperation is consistent with these empirical findings. It predicts that the adaptability of institutions for using and managing shared resources depends on the qualities of cooperation or non-cooperation with the rules. These are characterized by perceived fairness and bounded flexibility. Overall, I find that institutional performance over time depends on how the rules fit the users' sense of fairness as well as the specific features of the resource and its environment. This differs from current explanations in three ways. First, it broadens the analytical focus beyond interpersonal cooperation to include cooperation between users and the institution over time. Second, it recognizes that perceived fairness of an institution's rules is a determinant of its adaptability and performance over time. And third, it identifies the conditions under which flexibility or rigidity of rule application can contribute to institutional adaptability in changing circumstances.},

abstract = {We present analytical and numerical methods for determining the magnetic field distribution in a tubular permanent-magnet actuator (TPMA). In Part I, we present the semianalytical method. This method has the advantage of a relatively short computation time and it gives physical insight. We make an extension for skewed topologies, which offer the benefit of reducing the large force ripples of the TPMA. However, a lot of assumptions and simplifications with respect to the slotted structure have to be made in order to come to a relatively simple semianalytical description. To model the slotting effect and the related cogging force, we apply a Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) mapping for magnetic field and force calculations in Part II of the paper. Validation of the models is done with finite-element analysis.},

abstract = {A jet injector platform technology that provides improved performance over existing jet injectors through the use of a controllable linear Lorentz-force actuator and software-based control system has been developed. Injectors designed on this platform are capable of delivering injections using arbitrary pressure pulse shaping. Pulse shaping has been shown to allow a wide degree of control over the depth to which the injection is delivered. A software-based injector control system improves repeatability and allows for automatic reloading of the injector, a task that would be difficult to implement using existing jet injector platforms. A design for a prototype autoloading controllable jet injector (cJI) based on this platform is detailed. The injection capability of this cJI was evaluated both in-vitro and in-vivo using a tissue analog, excised porcine tissue, and ovine tissue. An analysis of the cJI's performance indicates that this design is capable of delivering a controllable volume of fluid to a controllable depth based entirely on the parameter's input into the control software.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical devices that are used on patients in fields containing potentially infectious body fluids can become contaminated and transmit infectious agents to other sites on the patient or to other patients if the devices are not properly cleaned and decontaminated after use on each patient treatment site. One such device is the needleless or jet injector, which is widely used in medicine and dentistry to deliver local anesthetic in procedures such as bone marrow aspirations, lumbar punctures, and cutaneous and intraoral injections. This study was conducted to determine whether cross-contamination can occur on in vitro reuse of a needleless injector and whether a manufacturer's recommended method of injector decontamination (ie, immersion sterilization) is effective in the prevention of cross-contamination. METHODS: The study was performed with new autoclaved injectors, fluorescein dye, and Streptococcus crista (the bacteria commonly found in saliva) in the field of use to determine whether these devices can become contaminated during use and carry over the contamination to other sites during immediate reuse. RESULTS: Fluorescein dye and bacteria tests with the needleless injectors showed that contamination or carryover does occur. It appeared to reduced to a minimum when a autoclaved, sterile rubber cap used over the head of the device during injection was replaced between each use, although replacement of the rubber cap alone did not prevent carryover. Immersion of the head of the injector in a 2{\%} glutaraldehyde solution for 30 minutes followed by a sterile water rinse and the replacement of the rubber cap with a sterile cap between uses was shown to curtail bacterial growth and prevent cross-contamination on immediate reuse of the device. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that needleless injectors become contaminated during in vitro use and direct contact with contaminated surfaces and that needless injectors carry over the contamination to subsequent sites of release. The replacement of the injector's rubber cap with a new one after initial discharge or the removal of an exposed rubber cap and immersion of the head of the injector in 2{\%} glutaraldehyde followed by a rinse of the head in sterile water, as recommended by one injector manufacturer, can minimize or eliminate the carryover.},

abstract = {Transdermal drug delivery occurs primarily through hypodermic needle injections, which cause pain, require a trained administrator, and may contribute to the spread of disease. With the growing number of pharmaceutical therapies requiring transdermal delivery, an effective, safe, and simple needle-free alternative is needed. We present and characterize a needle-free jet injector that employs a piezoelectric actuator to accelerate a micron-scale stream of fluid (40-130????m diameter) to velocities sufficient for skin penetration and drug delivery (50-160??m/s). Existing jet injectors, powered by compressed springs and gases, are not widely used due to painful injections and poor reliability in skin penetration depth and dose. In contrast, our device offers electronic control of the actuator expansion rate, resulting in direct control of jet velocity and thus the potential for more precise injections. We apply a simple fluid-dynamic model to predict the device response to actuator expansion. Further, we demonstrate that injection parameters including expelled volume, jet pressure, and penetration depth in soft materials vary with actuator expansion rate, but are highly coupled. Finally, we discuss how electronically-controlled jet injectors may enable the decoupling of injection parameters such as penetration depth and dose, improving the reliability of needle-free transdermal drug delivery. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Many modern pharmaceutical therapies such as vaccines and macromolecular drugs benefit from transdermal delivery. Conventional transdermal drug delivery via hypodermic needles causes pain, non-compliance, and potential contamination. Alternative transdermal strategies that deliver drugs in a quick, reliable, painless, and inexpensive way are needed. Jet injectors, which deliver drugs through the skin using a high-speed stream of liquid propelled by compressed springs or gasses, provide a needle-free method of trandermal drug delivery. However, poor reliability as well as painful bruising and bleeding characterize these devices, due in part to the high and constant jet velocity with which drugs are delivered. Toward improved reliability and reduced pain, we have developed a jet injector capable of dynamic control of jet velocity during a single injection pulse. Using this device, we demonstrate that temporal control of jet velocity leads to independent control of penetration depth, by adjusting time at high velocity, and delivered dose, by adjusting time at low velocity, in model materials. This dynamic control of jet velocity creates the potential for better control of needle-free injections, as demonstrated through injection studies on whole ex vivo human skin samples. ?? 2009.},

For this purpose, an improved magnetic equivalent circuit for calculation of the teeth and yoke flux densities in the LPMSMs is presented. The magnetic saturation of iron core is considered by nonlinear elements and an iterative procedure is used to update these elements. The armature reaction is also taken into account in the modeling by flux sources located on the teeth of motors. These sources are time dependent and can model every winding configuration. The relative motion between the motor primary and secondary is considered by wisely designing air gap elements simplifying the permeance network construction and preventing permeance matrix distortion during primary motion. Flux densities in different load conditions are calculated by means of the proposed model. The effects of saturation and armature reaction on the flux density distribution are shown in detail. Using these flux densities, iron losses in the motor are examined and its variations versus motor parameters are then studied. All results obtained by proposed model are verified by finite-element method based on an extensive analysis.},

This technique can be applied to rotary, linear, and tubular permanent-magnet actuators, either with a slotless or slotted armature. In addition to permanent-magnet machines, this technique can be applied to any 2-D geometry with the restriction that the geometry should consist of rectangular regions. The method obtains the electromagnetic field distribution by solving the Laplace and Poisson equations for every region, together with a set of boundary conditions. Here, we compare the method with finite-element analyses for various examples and show its applicability to a wide class of geometries.},

On the other hand, a multilayer perceptron feedforward network (trained by a backpropagation algorithm) that works as a hysteresis band comparator is used.

Currently, the Carter coefficient is applied to compensate the slot effects. This coefficient is calculated with respect to the slot dimensions and air gap length, using Carter formulas and corresponding curves. These curves are taken by solving the two dimensional Laplace equation for voltage, and cannot be accurate (errorless) completely. Nowadays, using FEM (finite element method) packages of numerical methods, slot effects on the air gap flux distribution are calculated carefully. In this paper using the ANSYS package of FE, these effects are studied. Using the results of these studies and comparing them with the Carter method, the Carter coefficient is modified.},

This paper questions the desirability of the flux weakening approach for a number of applications where energy efficiency is of prime importance, such as in electric vehicles.

Linear induction motors dominate the field of linear drives to the same extent as does the rotary induction machine in relation to more complicated adjustable-speed motors. It is therefore thought appropriate to devote only one section to linear motors other than induction. A fairly full treatment of electromagnetic levitation is also included together with a treatment of oscillating machines. Perhaps the most important features are the division of electrical machines into two classes which are termed "magnetic" and "electromagnetic" and the "topological explosion" which is at present taking place in linear motor design. Some linear machines are already well established on a commercial basis but the vast bulk of recent inventions still remain to be exploited.},

These end effects are important in small-scale precision actuators where geometric constraints preclude the use of larger finite arrays that emulate the behavior of infinite arrays. We demonstrate how to model and compute the field characteristics along a plane using two-dimensional Fast Fourier transforms. Model predictions are compared with analytical solutions for a simple prototype magnet array, measured values of a magnet array's flux density, and a meso-scale actuator's behavior.

Inherently, rotor of rotary motor has infinite rotational length with respect to its rotation while mover of the linear motor has finite length with respect to mover's translation. In this paper, we propose and validate a design method. By means of the method magnetic field can be calculated theoretically. General electrical motor without slotted yoke, therefore, can be designed analytically. Using the method, the linear motor with finite mover can be designed more accurately considering the flux leakage at both end of the mover. We introduce the method in designing the linear motor with Halbach magnet array. We also investigate the difference between conventional method that does not consider the finiteness and proposed one that considers it. Using the method, the magnetic field emanated from magnet can be obtained so accurately that actuating force characteristics of the motor can be predicted more precisely.

It is based on providing the voltage to the RF PA with variations that mimic the shape of the envelope of the communication signal that the RF PA is processing. As the bandwidth of these signals can be around several megahertz, the switching frequency of the switching mode power supply designed for ET applications has to be very high. The good switching characteristics of Gallium Nitride devices makes them suitable for this application.

abstract = {This paper presents an envelope tracking (ET) transmitter architecture based on the combination of a novel 3-bit (N = 3) supply modulator and digital predistortion (DPD). The proposed power converter is based on a direct digital-to-analog conversion architecture that implements the binary-coded sum of N isolated dc voltages, allowing the synthesis of an output waveform with L = 2N voltage levels, with a binary distribution in the range $\Delta$V = VM - VO (maximum voltage VM, offset voltage Vo). This solution provides a better voltage resolution VS = $\Delta$V/(2N-1) with respect to typical multilevel switched-sources topologies (VS = $\Delta$V/N). The improved voltage resolution enables the correction of the residual discretization error in the ET transmitter by means of DPD of the RF signal without the need of an auxiliary linear envelope amplifier. The proposed ET solution has been tested with an L-band 30-W lateral-diffused MOS RF high power amplifier (RF HPA) with 1.4- and 10-MHz long-term-evolution signals. In these conditions the converter demonstrated 92{\%} and 83{\%} efficiency, respectively, whereas the congregate efficiency of the transmitter are 38.3{\%} and 23.9{\%} at 5.5 and 1.9 W of average RF output power, respectively. These performances correspond to an improvement of 17.2 and 17.9 points for the power-added efficiency of the RF HPA and to 13.4 and 13 points of improvement for the efficiency of the entire transmitter with respect to fixed bias operation.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method for the efficiency optimization of ultrahigh-speed permanent-magnet machines. Analytical methods are applied for the modeling of the machine that is equipped with a diametrically magnetized rotor and a slotless stator. The outer dimensions of the machine are design constraints, and the internal dimensioning is optimized for minimum losses. The air-friction losses are taken into account in addition to the usual iron, copper, and eddy-current losses. Laminated silicon-iron or laminated amorphous iron is used as the stator core material. The results show that air-friction losses influence the optimum design considerably, leading to a small rotor diameter at high speeds. The loss minimization and the amorphous iron core make it possible to reduce the calculated losses by 63{\%} as compared to a machine design not considering air-friction losses. The resulting efficiency is 95{\%} for a 100-W 500 000-r/min machine excluding bearing losses. Experimental results are shown to illustrate the validity of the method.},

abstract = {In 2003 the Roadmapping Initiative of the European Center of Power Electronics (ECPE) has been started based on a future vision of society in 2020 in order to define the future role of power electronics, and to identify technological barriers and prepare new technologies well in time. In the framework of this initiative a new mathematically supported approach for the roadmapping in power electronics has been developed. As described in this paper the procedure relies on a comprehensive mathematical modeling and subsequent multi-objective optimization of a converter system. The relationship between the technological base and the performance of the system then exists as a mathematical representation, whose optimization assures the best possible exploitation of the available degrees of freedom and technologies. Thus an objective Technology Node of a system is obtained, whereby physical limits are implicitly taken into account. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the system performance with regard to the technological base can be calculated directly and the internal interdependence of Performance Indices directly studied. Accordingly, the improvement in performance achievable by improvements in the technology base can be tested and assessed in advance. Moreover, different system concepts, i.e. circuit topologies, control procedures, etc. can be evaluated and directly compared with regard to achievable efficiency, power density and costs in the form of the associated Pareto Front which defines the boundary of the Feasible Performance Space. If the target performance lies outside the Pareto Envelope of known system concepts and state-of-the-art technologies, a new technology must be employed. The necessity of a technological leap, i.e. the introduction of a Disruptive Technology can thus be recognized at an early stage. This offers an excellent basis for effective roadmapping for various main application areas in power electronics.},

abstract = {Besides product differentiation, cost is a key parameter for market success and sustainable competitive advantage of industrial companies. Academic research in the field of power electronics, however, is often confined to the search for technical innovations or optimizations with focus on pure physical performance indices while the cost dimension is neglected. An explanation for the lack of such cost considerations is the generally poor availability of cost data in academia. This paper discusses the necessity of an increased awareness and sensitivity towards costs and the related opportunities for academic research. Furthermore, cost models for the power semiconductors, the passive components, the cooling systems and the printed circuit boards of switched-mode power converters with an approximate rated power between 5 and 50kW are derived. Based on manufacturer prices for large ordering quantities, numerical values for the cost model parameters are proposed. An example of a multi-objective comparison of different power converter topologies for photovoltaic applications regarding efficiency, volume and total semiconductor chip area is extended by the cost dimension to demonstrate the benefits of employing the developed cost models.},

A multi-objective optimization procedure is detailed, which employs an electrical converter model and coupled electro-thermal component models. Each component model determines the corresponding losses, volumes, and temperature rises. A detailed description of the inductor model is given which considers high frequency winding losses as well as core losses, and calculates the temperature rises inside the inductor, e.g. the hot-spot winding temperature. Based on the determined $\eta$-$\rho$ Pareto front, the most suitable realization of the proposed UPS system is determined, which is based on the resulting sensitivities of the design parameters (switching frequency, current ripples, magnetic materials, etc.) on the performance of power converter system (efficiency and power density). As a result, a switching frequency of 16 kHz, maximum relative input and output side current ripples of 20{\%}, amorphous core materials for DM inductors, and nanocrystalline core materials for CM inductors are selected in order to achieve a converter efficiency of 96.6{\%} at a power density of 2.3 kVA/dm3.},

Even though the fuel cell and fuel container may scale down well, the pumps, blowers, and power converters required may dominate the system mass. This paper focuses on the tradeoff between efficiency and converter mass, and achieving the design objective of minimum mass of both converter and fuel. The effect of desired run-time, or mission duration, on the optimal dc-dc converter design was explored in detail. The effort focused on boost converters; however, the methodology can be applied to any converter topology. In an example case, at a mission length of 100 h, the optimized converter saved 91 g of system mass when compared to an off-the-shelf dc-dc converter},

abstract = {Conventional multi-kW three-phase power converters (e.g. 380 V output) based on silicon (Si) devices (e.g. IGBTs) typically operate at switching frequencies of 50 kHz or less. By contrast, silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs are capable of switching at frequencies of up to several hundreds of kHz while still maintaining high efficiency operation. This opens up opportunities for greater system design optimisation, such as determining the smallest possible power converter volume and weight. Of particular interest is how the switching frequency affects the size of the passive components (e.g. heatsink, line filter, dc-link capacitor and EMI filter) which account for around 70-80{\%} of the power converter's volume and weight. This paper presents a set of models that outline the effect that changing the switching frequency has on the design of a 2-level, 3-phase inverter using silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs as the active switches. In particular it will focus on the effect of the switching frequency on the design of the passive components.},

This paper addresses design and implementation of monolithic GaN half-bridge power stages with integrated gate drivers optimized for pulse-widthmodulated (PWM) dc-dc converters operating at 100 MHz switching frequency. Three gate-driver circuit topologies are considered for integration with half-bridge power stages in a 0.15m depletion-mode GaN-on-SiC process: an active pull-up driver, a bootstrapped driver, and a novel modified active pull-up driver. An analytical loss model is developed and used to optimize the monolithic GaN chips, which are then used to construct 20 V, 5 W, 100 MHz synchronous buck converter prototypes. With the bootstrapped and the modified pull-up gate-driver circuits, power stage efficiencies above 91{\%} and total efficiencies close to 88{\%} are demonstrated. The modified active pull-up driver, which offers 80{\%} reduction in the driver area, is found to be the bestperforming approach in the depletion-mode GaN process. These results demonstrate feasibility of high-efficiency VHF PWM dc-dc converters based on high levels of integration in GaN processes.},

A two-stage inverter along with an active filter to eliminate double-frequency content of the dc-link current is proposed for the topology of module-integrated inverter, and three candidate topologies were taken into account for the dc-dc stage. Efficiency, volume, and reliability of the converters are taken as objective functions, and comprehensive component modeling is performed. Pareto frontiers reveal that the limits of the system are illustrated, which help the designer to pick the most suitable topology and design for the entire converter. Experimental results show the validity of the modeling and optimization technique.},

In this paper, firstly the converter is theoretically analyzed, obtaining its operation, losses and efficiency equations, these equations are used to obtain optimizations maps based on the main system parameters. In this way, the ideal design parameters can be visually obtained. These optimization maps are the key to quantify the potential benefits of GaN transistors in this type of converters. Theoretical results show that using GaN transistors, the frequency of the converter can be pushed from 125kHz to 830kHz without sacrificing the converter efficiency. This frequency increase is directly related to reduction on the EPC size and weight.},

However, the dead-time related losses in GaN HEMT based converters can be detrimental if not optimized, especially when operating at very high switching frequencies. This paper proposes an original analytical model for dead-time optimization for the GaN converters. The proposed model is more accurate than conventional dead-time optimization methods used in Si converters. A GaN based synchronous boost converter is used as a case study. Circuit simulation and experimental tests are successfully performed to verify the analysis and proposed model.},

abstract = {Interleaving in synchronous rectifiers can lead to reduced losses in both the active and passive components. However, this depends on selecting the correct number of phases and the correct phase inductance for a particular application and requirements. In this paper optimizing the number of phases and the phase inductance is considered to maximize the interleaved synchronous rectifiers efficiency over the desired operating range. To do this, the RMS currents and losses in the bus capacitors, the phase inductances and the switching devices as a function of the number of phases and duty cycle are considered. Generic equations are presented and used to predict the RMS currents in the passive components with some non-intuitive results especially concerning the bus capacitors. It is shown in the paper, that the optimum number of phases is dependent on the converter parameters such as the phase inductance and operating requirements. Practical results are presented confirming the synchronous rectifier loss model.},

Various technology considerations are presented, including the optimization of the power-switching transistor and passives integration. Two design examples for integrated dc-dc converters are implemented in a 0.5-$\mu$m GaAs E/D pHEMT process. The first uses coupled inductors to reduce the current ripple and enhance the dynamic performance of the converter. The two-phase, 0.5 A/phase converter occupies 2 mm × 2.1 mm without the output network. An 8.7-nH filter coupled inductor is implemented in 65-$\mu$m-thick top copper metal layer, and flip-chip bonded to the dc-dc converter board. The presented converter converts 4.5-V input to 3.3-V output at 150-MHz switching frequency with a measured power efficiency of 84{\%}, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for similar current/voltage ratings. The second example is a hysteric controlled, 100-MHz switching frequency single-phase GaAs pHEMT buck converter designed to drive power amplifier loads. The design can deliver up to 37-dB{\textperiodcentered}m output power and has a peak efficiency of 88{\%} and a 3-dB bandwidth of 14.5 MHz.},

abstract = {Recent advances in silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductor technology and resulting availability of SiC Schottky rectifiers and controlled devices (bipolar junction transistors, JFETs, and MOSFETs) make it possible to design and implement power converters capable of operating at 200 °C. The design, prototype development, operation, and testing of a 74 kHz, 2 kW, 100 V/270 V inversely coupled, interleaved, dc–dc boost converter over the 20–200 °C temperature range is presented in this paper. The advantages of coupled-inductor interleaved boost converters include increased efficiency, reduced size, reduced electromagnetic emission, faster transient response, and improved reliability. Optimization of a high temperature X-perm core-based coupled inductor architecture, in terms of ac flux balancing and dc flux cancellation is discussed. DC characterization of SiC power devices used in the design (Schottky rectifier and JFET) over the 20–200 °C temperature range is presented as well. The power stage of the converter, including the power semiconductor devices, coupled inductor, and X7R ceramic input and output filter capacitors, was placed inside a temperature controlled chamber for testing. JFET gate drive circuit, input power source, and output load were external to the environmental chamber. Converter testing and performance evaluation was accomplished over a 20–200 °C ambient temperature range. As expected, JFET conduction loss increased and converter efficiency decreased with increasing temperatures. The drop in converter efficiency was in the range of 2{\%}–4{\%} over the entire load (200 W to 2 kW) and temperature (20–200 °C) ranges evaluated. At 200 °C, output voltage ripple increased by ∼60{\%} due to the rapid decline in X7R capacitance at the high-- emperature extreme. The results obtained during this study suggest that the realization of 200 °C power converters is feasible through a judicious selection of power semiconductor devices, magnetic core materials, and capacitor dielectrics. As a result, high temperature, frequency, and power density converters are expected to be a reality in the near future.},

For the experiments, a dedicated single-phase resonant converter rated at 1 kV, 250 A (250-kW peak power, duty ratio 10{\%}, 25-kW average power, AND pulse length 1 ms) was been developed. This converter represents one phase of a multiphase resonant power supply designed for long-pulse modulation (typically 1-2 ms) when equipped with a suitable output transformer. Pulsed operation is obtained by direct modulation of the high-frequency power supply. The main aim of the study reported here is to develop a methodology to assess performance and reliability issues related to the use of standard commercially available power switch technology, relying on a physics-based multichip insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) structure model, and to experimentally monitor the chip temperature using high-speed thermal imaging, during the pulse, to identify any limitations of the proposed modulator technology. First, an overview of the converter, including its nominal electrical design, is provided. Optimization of the turn-OFF snubber capacitance is performed through a series of experiments, employing calorimetrically measured losses, to determine a value, which minimizes the overall power losses. Accurate calorimetric measurements of the switching losses and infrared measurements of the IGBT surface temperatures during transient operation are presented. Simulations including multichip structures, experimental results, and high-quality chip thermal images are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

abstract = {Thermal management plays a pivotal role in achieving high power densities in converters. Improvement on thermal performance of critical components in printed-circuit board (PCB) assembled switch mode converters is achieved by using design techniques that extend across electromagnetic, geometrical, and thermal-integration technologies. For better use of the already available PCB material, three-dimensional component layout and flexible PCB technology are utilized to gain advantages. A theory to evaluate the thermal-management effectiveness of switch mode converters is introduced based on two new figures of merit, namely thermal-management loss density and thermal-design rating. These two figures of merit quantify the effective use of thermal-management material as well as the thermal performance of a converter design. The figure-of-merit criteria allow flexibility so that it can be adjusted to an appropriate design objective. Design objectives include achieving higher power densities or achieving good reliability. The thermal-management-effectiveness theory is applied here to thermally optimize a Flyback converter that has been geometrically integrated. The design technique to adjust the thermal-management effectiveness of integrated switch mode converters to achieve a set objective, by means of the introduced figures of merit, forms the core of the publication, validated by experimental measurements},

In cases when skin effect is negligible, the corresponding eddy-current losses in magnets can be reduced by segmentation of magnets. In this paper, we propose an analytical method to evaluate the effect of both circumferential and axial segmentations on losses' reduction in various conditions, concerning the skin effect. With the skin effect operating, the magnets' division may lead to increase rather than decrease of the eddy-current losses. A criterion to determine range of parameters leading to this unexpected situation is presented. Finite-element calculation confirms the results of the analysis.},

abstract = {Pulsed-power systems traditionally have been designed to provide a pulse that is non programmable or requires hardware modifications to adjust the output waveform shape. Advancements in pulsed-power technologies are enabling system designs that allow for greater flexibility such as programmable current shaping. Material science, which uses current pulse shaping to obtain data for the equation of state analysis, is driving much of this work. The programming of pulsed-power systems through the use of simulations and manual curve fitting techniques can work well for systems that only have a few controllable parameters and are generating waveforms with simple spectral content. Complex systems with many controllable parameters become unmanageable for manual trial and error to be effective. This paper discusses the characterization and modeling of a scaled down programmable current adder directed at investigating technical issues that will be encountered in full-scale drivers. A discussion of the procedure used to optimize the adder current output, using genetic algorithms, is presented. The approach to system programmability presented in this paper will allow for a more simplified user interface and system control, as the requirements for flexibility and complexity in future systems increase.},

An experimental performance comparison between SiC JFET, Si MOSFET-SiC JFET cascode configuration and SiC MOSFET used as the main switch for a dc/dc boost converter (150 V/400 V) operating in Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) is presented. The comparison of the different SiC devices is made in terms of the global boost-converter efficiency. Several experimental results dealing with the switching behavior of these SiC switches at different switching frequencies (from 100 kHz to 1 MHz) have been carried out in order to optimize the efficiency of the converter at different output power (300 W and 600 W). A good performance of all these switches is obtained from the point of view of the efficiency, highlighting the Si MOSFET-SiC JFET cascode behavior at 1MHz with an efficiency of 97.5{\%} at 600 W. In addition, a possible application in the field of solar panels is proposed using the SiC JFET as the main switch. Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and DCM are tested at different switching frequencies with an output power of 1 kW and the results obtained are compared to the most widely reported in the bibliography.},

Based on the current reference, in each switching cycle, the optimal number of power switch segments and the gate voltage swing level for power MOSFETS are set through a sequence controller and a gate voltage scaling circuit.

This tool, developed in Matlab environment, is based on multiobjective optimization (MO) using genetic algorithms. The Elitist Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm is used to perform search and optimization whereas analytical models are used to model the power converters. The design problem requires minimizing the weight, losses and cost of the converter while ensuring the satisfaction of a number of constraints. The optimization variables are, as for them, the operating frequency, the current density, the maximum flux density, the transformer dimensions, the wire diameter, the core material, the conductor material, the converter topology (among Flyback, Forward, Push?Pull, half?bridge and full?bridge topologies), the number of semiconductor devices associated in parallel, the number of cells associated in series or parallel as well as the kinds of input and output connections (serial or parallel) of these cells. Finally, the design of an auxiliary railway power supply is presented and discussed.Findings ? The results show that such tool to design dc?dc power converters presents several advantages. In particular, it proposes to the designer a set of solutions ? instead of a single one ? so that he can choose a posteriori which solution best fits the application under consideration.

abstract = {Optimization of power electronic converters is certainly not a new subject. However, past efforts have been focused on the use of commercial off-the-shelf components in the design optimization. Thus the resulting system was really optimized only over the set of available components which may in fact represent only a subset of the design space; a reachable space limited somewhat artificially by available components and technologies. While this approach is suited for the engineer seeking to cost-reduce an existing design, it offers little insight into design possibilities for greenfield projects. Instead, this paper seeks to first broaden the reachable design space to identify a globally optimal design for some given objective, from which specifications for the individual components can be derived. A unique outcome of this approach is that new technology development vectors are expected to develop optimized components for the optimized power converter. The approach presented in this paper uses a descriptive language to abstract the characteristics and attributes of the components used in a power electronic converter in a way suitable for multi-objective and constrained optimization methods. This paper will apply this concept by developing generalized energy loss models under non-sinusoidal waveforms for the three most prevalent power supply components: semiconductor switches, inductors and capacitors, these models will be used to form an objective function for the optimization problem, weighted by the optimization parameters of size, weight, cost, and performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, a bee colony optimization (BCO) algorithm is adapted to the current control strategy of power factor (PF) correction for a Sheppard-Taylor converter. The control approach is developed to eliminate the input current harmonics in the converter. The BCO algorithm is a new population-based search algorithm which is one of the metaheuristic techniques based on swarm intelligence. This algorithm depends on modeling the natural behavior of real honey bees. In this approach, duty cycles are generated by the BCO algorithm for the Sheppard-Taylor converter switch to obtain unity PF (UPF) and lower total harmonic distortion of the input current. The duty cycles for half a line period are calculated and stored in a lookup table. By synchronizing the memory with the line, near-unity PFs can be achieved in an operating point. The feedforward is also used into the control algorithm with the maximum value of the input voltage. The implementation of feedforward improves the converter performance. The input current of the converter is operated in continuous conduction mode. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control strategy works well and the UPF can be achieved with wide input voltage, load, and parameter variation. The results are compatible with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61000-3-2 current harmonic standard.},

A combined control principle of levitation and propulsion for TFLIM is proposed. The output capacity of the power converter for control is limited by its maximum current, but the performance of TFLIM depends on its fundamental component. Then a third harmonic current injection scheme is considered for the drive system, in order to increase the fundamental component, keeping the value of the maximum current invariant. TFLIM characteristics are calculated both for the levitation and propulsion forces acting on the secondary steel plate, on the basis of a 3D electromagnetic field analysing program (J-MAG Studio). In comparison with a sinusoidal current excitation, the propulsion and levitation force of TFLIM increases by 33{\%} and 37{\%}, respectively, when the harmonic current injection level is optimized. Thus, the harmonic current injection scheme is shown to be an effective and practical mean to realize a steel plate conveyance system.},

abstract = { In order to ensure the compatibility between devices, several electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards specify the maximum permitted levels of radiated noise. To comply with these standards, hard switching power converters need to use expensive solutions, namely shielding, Filtering techniques and snubbers, because the voltages have low values of rise and fall times. This fact leads into significant harmonic content at high frequencies. In this case, the most cost effective way to deal with radiated noise is to reduce it at the source. A way to achieve this goal is to impose moderate values of output voltage rise and fall times. This paper theoretically and experimentally explains, that the harmonic content at high frequencies can be significantly reduced with a selection of a suitable value of voltage rise time and fall time. Based on the study of a generic trapezoidal waveform, simple but precise equations, that permit to easily evaluate the envelope of the frequency spectrum, are derived. These equations also permit to analyze the importance and the influence of the rise and fall times in the spectrum envelope. Finally, with this simple analysis, the influence of the values of rise time and fall time in more complex waveforms are shown, as the output voltage waveform of a high frequency cycloconverter. The validity of the theoretical analysis is confirmed by experimental results.},

However, semi-soft current commutation and optimal sequence switching can be used to minimise commutation losses so that at high switching frequencies the total losses in the matrix converter can be less than those in a conventional rectifier-inverter combination. The viability of the matrix converter depends to a large extent on the size and cost of the input filter components required to meet international power quality standards. In this paper, filter designs are examined and guidelines established. Practical tests have been carried out on a 3.5 kW power converter to validate computer models. It is concluded that the matrix converter is viable if the right combination of semiconductor switching techniques and input filter design are employed},

abstract = {In telecom applications, the vision for a total power conversion efficiency from the mains to the output of point-of-load (PoL) converters of 95{\%} demands optimization of every conversion step, i.e., the power factor correction (PFC) rectifier front-end should show an outstanding efficiency in the range of 99{\%}. For recently discussed 400-V dc distribution bus voltages, a buck-type PFC rectifier is a logical solution. In this paper, an efficiency-optimized, 98.8{\%} efficient, 5-kW three-phase buck-type PFC rectifier with 400-V output is presented. Methods for calculating losses of all components are described and are used to optimize the converter design for efficiency at full load. Special attention is paid to semiconductor losses, which are shown to be dominant, with the parasitic device capacitance losses being a significant component. The calculation of these parasitic capacitance losses is treated in detail, and the charge-balance approach used is verified. A prototype of the proposed rectifier is constructed which verifies the accuracy of the models used for loss calculation and optimization.},

Then, a set of decoupled optimization problems are formulated as a function of the available modulation degrees of freedom to minimize the predominant converter losses. Finally, a simple and practical specific modulation strategy is provided resembling the optimum solutions. The good performance of the proposed three-level NPC DAB converter operated with the proposed modulation strategy and voltage balancing control is verified through simulation and experiments. The capacitor voltage balancing can be guaranteed for all operating conditions. In addition, it is concluded that the multilevel topology provides benefits compared with the conventional two-level DAB converter.},

abstract = {The trend toward high power density, high operating frequency, and low profile in power converters has exposed a number of limitations in the use of conventional wire-wound magnetic component structures. A planar magnetic is a low-profile transformer or inductor utilizing planar windings, instead of the traditional windings made of Cu wires. In this paper, the most important factors for planar transformer (PT) design including winding loss, core loss, leakage inductance, and stray capacitance have individually been investigated. The tradeoffs among these factors have to be analyzed in order to achieve optimal parameters. Combined with an application, four typical winding arrangements have been compared to illustrate their advantages and disadvantages. An improved interleaving structure with optimal behaviors is proposed, which constructs the top layer paralleling with the bottom layer and then in series with the other turns of the primary, so that a lower magnetomotive force ratio m can be obtained, as well as minimized ac resistance, leakage inductance, and even stray capacitance. A 1.2-kW full-bridge dc-dc converter prototype employing the improved PT structure has been constructed, over 96{\%} efficiency is achieved, and a 2.7{\%} improvement, compared with the noninterleaving structure, is obtained.},

With the improvements in switching performance and low parasitic packaging provided by eGaN FETs, the printed circuit board (PCB) layout becomes critical to converter performance. This paper will study the effect of PCB layout parasitic inductance on efficiency and peak device voltage stress for an eGaN FET-based point of load (POL) converter operating at a switching frequency of 1 MHz, an input voltage range of 12-28 V, an output voltage of 1.2 V, and an output current up to 20 A. This paper will also compare the parasitic inductances of conventional PCB layouts and propose an improved PCB design, providing a 40{\%} decrease in parasitic inductance over the best conventional PCB design.},

The study considers practical implementation of a DC–DC boost converter as a solar PV pre-regulator in terms of thermal management, with comparative thermal performance evaluations of silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors and silicon (Si) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). Thermal performance evaluation of power semiconductors is based on a 1.2 kW DC–DC converter with: (i) various switching frequencies up to 300 kHz, in steps of 25 kHz; (ii) case temperatures from 25 to 150°C; and (iii) a natural convection heatsink with temperature increase rate of 0.5°C/ W. Simulation and experimental results verify that losses from SiC semiconductors are low compared with Si MOSFETs. This provides an opportunity for designing a pre-regulator DC–DC boost converter with less effort required for thermal management and enhanced reliability},

An experimental 500 W interleaved BCM boost PFC converters is built and its performance is evaluated while adopting each of the three semiconductor devices as the main switch. The overall efficiency and thermal performance of the experimental boost PFC converter are analyzed under three different operational conditions: one operational condition with the baseline switching frequency of f{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s base{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 65 kHz and the other two conditions with f{\textless}sub{\textgreater}s base{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 130 kHz and 200 kHz. The three baseline frequencies are selected in consideration of IEC 61000-3-2 and CISRR 22 EMC standards for conducted emission noise. This study confirms that the GaN HEMT exhibits the superior switching characteristics and pronounces its merits at high frequency operations. The current paper highlights the efficiency improvement with the GaN HEMT and demonstrates its application potentials to high power density/low profile BCM boost PFC converters.},

It is further shown that the future optimal choice for bipolar devices is C (diamond) owing to the large bandgap, high thermal conductivity, and large electron and hole mobilities. A new expression relating the critical electric field for breakdown in abrupt junctions to the material bandgap energy is derived and is further used to derive new expressions for specific on-resistance in power semiconductor devices. These new expressions are compared to the previous literature and the efficacy of specific power devices, such as heterojunction MOSFETs, using GaN are discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper a generalized description and an overview of degrees of freedom and selected measures for efficiency improvement of power electronics converters is given. The background of all considerations is formed by single-phase PFC rectifier systems, but the concepts shown are fundamental and fully applicable for other converter systems. First, the influence of the main components of the losses of a converter on the efficiency characteristic over the output power is discussed. Subsequently, a detailed analysis of the possibilities, of minimizing the semiconductor losses, the losses of the passive components including the EMI filter, and the power requirements of auxiliary systems in the course of the design process are given. In this context also the technological boundaries that limit the maximum efficiency of a converter are clarified and the compromise that always has to be made between efficiency and power density is highlighted. Furthermore, a control procedure is discussed to maximize the efficiency in the partial load range and a resonant transition mode ZVS converter system is presented that allows to attain efficiencies significantly over 99{\%} without the use of SiC semiconductors. In addition the accuracy of the input and output power measurements required for measuring highest efficiencies is clarified, whereby the advantage of a direct loss measurement by means of a calorimeter becomes immediately clear. Finally, results of measurements on a demonstrator of a CCM single-phase PFC rectifier system with 99.1{\%} max. efficiency and $\eta$ {\textgreater} 99{\%} above half rated power, and on a resonant transition mode PFC rectifier system with $\eta$max = 99.3{\%} and $\eta$ {\textgreater} 99{\%} above 15{\%} rated power are presented.},

abstract = {Power density of power electronic converters in different applications has roughly doubled every 10 years since 1970. Behind this trajectory was the continuous advancement of power semiconductor device technology allowing an increase of converter switching frequencies by a factor of 10 every decade. However, today's cooling concepts, and passive components and wire bond interconnection technologies could be major barriers for a continuation of this trend. For identifying and quantifying such technological barriers this paper investigates the volume of the cooling system and of the main passive components for the basic forms of power electronics energy conversion in dependency of the switching frequency and determines switching frequencies minimizing the total volume. The analysis is for 5 kW rated output power, high performance air cooling, advanced power semiconductors, and single systems in all cases. A power density limit of 28 kW/dm3@300 kHz is calculated for an isolated DC-DC converter considering only transformer, output inductor and heat sink volume. For single-phase AC-DC conversion a general limit of 35 kW/dm3 results from the DC link capacitor required for buffering the power fluctuating with twice the mains frequency. For a three-phase unity power factor PWM rectifier the limit is 45 kW/dm3@810 kHz just taking into account EMI filter and cooling system. For the sparse matrix converter the limiting components are the input EMI filter and the common mode output inductor; the power density limit is 71 kW/dm3@50 kHz when not considering the cooling system. The calculated power density limits highlight the major importance of broadening the scope of research in power electronics from traditional areas like converter topologies, and modulation and control concepts to cooling systems, high frequency electromagnetics, interconnection technology, multi-functional integration, packaging and multi-domain modeling and simu- lation to ensure further advancement of the field along the power density trajectory.},

@article{Hanigovszki2006,
abstract = {The most common solution for modern adjustable speed drives (ASD) is the use of induction motors (IM) fed by voltage-source inverters (VSI). The inverter generates a pulsewidth modulated (PWM) voltage, with dv/dt values of about 6 kV/{\&}mu;s or even more. In three-leg inverters for three-phase applications the occurrence of common-mode voltage is inherent due to asymmetrical output pulses. As a result, for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) reasons, in most applications shielded cables are used between the inverter and the motor, implying high installation costs. The present paper discusses the use of cheaper, unshielded cables from an EMC point-of-view. A new method for measuring electromagnetic interference (EMI) from unshielded cables is proposed and measurement results are presented. The level of EMI is evaluated in different situations: without an output filter, with a classical LC output filter and with an advanced output filter with dc link feedback. It is concluded that, from an EMC point of view, unshielded cables can give very good performance provided that a common-mode (CM) output filter is used.},

abstract = {In modern power electronics, the design of power converters relies on accurate modeling of losses of all components. Losses in the switches are usually the most important point to be considered in a converter design; however, switching losses are not always provided in datasheets. Typical methods for measuring switching losses, such as the double-pulse method, need the insertion of current and voltage probes across the device. These probes add parasitic elements into the power loop, which modifies the switching behavior, especially when modern semiconductor devices, such as Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistors, are considered. Thus, with the purpose of precisely measuring switching losses, an opposition method test bench has been built to characterize, under real working conditions, one GaN power transistor. The measurement method employed can accurately estimate turn-on and turn-off losses, separately. It does not add parasitic elements to the circuit, which ensures operation at the same conditions of the real converter. Results obtained from this method show the switching characteristics of a specific GaN device and measurements include the power dissipation in a reverse conduction mode. These results help to show the best operation points of the device to maximize the efficiency of a given application.},

This has profoundly changed our world and our lives. Now we cannot live without electrical products any-more and, thus, we are surrounded with electro-magnetic fields generated. On the other side, especially in the past few decades, the rapid development and wide deployment of electrical products have caused lots of troubles, among which the most prominent one is electromagnet-ic interference (EMI), which may impact other {\textcopyright} MASTER SERIES FOURTH QUARTER 2009 IEEE CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS MAGAZINE 11 devices' performance and harm human beings' health. There-fore, fighting EMI has become a stringent, difficult problem faced by engineers and scientists. The sources of EMI include natural sources, like atmospheric charge/discharge phenom-ena and extraterrestrial radiation, and man-made sources, like power lines, auto ignition, radio frequency interference, and radiation hazards, to name just a few. As important components, direct current (DC-DC) converters are embed-ded and employed in various electrical devices, thus form-ing main sources of EMI. Some measures, such as filters and electromagnetic shielding, have been taken to suppress EMI, but these methods have various drawbacks with respect to cost, volume, weight, and efficiency. Therefore, new theories and methodologies are desired to cope with the EMI problem, and chaos theory is a candidate due to the continuous spec-trum feature of chaos. This paper aims to provide an over-view on the state of the art of traditional EMI suppression technologies, and to introduce the use of chaos theory and chaos control to reduce EMI, as well as to motivate more ef-forts in theoretical research and engineering practice.},

It is generally believed that the reduced input ripple current will lower down the DM EMI noise magnitude, which will make the DM Alter smaller. However, for most of today's PFC, running in the frequency range of 75 kHz {\~{}} 150 kHz, the conventional 2-channel interleaving technique cannot help to reduce the EMI filter size at all. In this switching frequency range, the EMI filter design is based on the 2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}nd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} order harmonic, which cannot be reduced by the conventional interleaving. In this paper, a 2-channel PFC operating with 90 degree phase shift is introduced. It can cancel the 2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}nd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} order harmonic and reduce the 3{\textless}sup{\textgreater}rd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} order harmonic, and the EMI filter size can be reduced. This novel interleaving strategy can be further extended to other switching frequency range and other multi-channel interleaved PFC.},

abstract = {A clear explanation of the technology for producing and delivering electricity Electric Power Systems explains and illustrates how the electric grid works in a clear, straightforward style that makes highly technical material accessible. It begins with a thorough discussion of the underlying physical concepts of electricity, circuits, and complex power that serves as a foundation for more advanced material. Readers are then introduced to the main components of electric power systems, including generators, motors and other appliances, and transmission and distribution equipment such as power lines, transformers, and circuit breakers. The author explains how a whole power system is managed and coordinated, analyzed mathematically, and kept stable and reliable. Recognizing the economic and environmental implications of electric energy production and public concern over disruptions of service, this book exposes the challenges of producing and delivering electricity to help inform public policy decisions. Its discussions of complex concepts such as reactive power balance, load flow, and stability analysis, for example, offer deep insight into the complexity of electric grid operation and demonstrate how and why physics constrains economics and politics. Although this survival guide includes mathematical equations and formulas, it discusses their meaning in plain English and does not assume any prior familiarity with particular notations or technical jargon. Additional features include: * A glossary of symbols, units, abbreviations, and acronyms * Illustrations that help readers visualize processes and better understand complex concepts * Detailed analysis of a case study, including a Web reference to the case, enabling readers to test the consequences of manipulating various parameters With its clear discussion of how electric grids work, Electric Power Systems is appropriate for a broad readership of professionals, undergraduate and graduate students, government agency managers, environmental advocates, and consumers.},

abstract = {A novel isolated zero-voltage-transition (ZVT) boost converter with coupled inductors is proposed in this paper to satisfy the high power, high step-up, and isolated requirements. In the proposed converter, the input-parallel configuration is adopted to share the large input current and to reduce the conduction losses, while the output-series structure is employed to double the output voltage gain. Consequently, a transformer with a low turns ratio can be applied, which makes the transformer design and optimize easily. Moreover, the active clamp circuits are employed to reduce the switch voltage stress and to recycle the energy stored in the leakage inductance. The ZVT is achieved during the whole switching transition for all the active switches, so the switching losses can be reduced greatly. Furthermore, the diode reverse-recovery problem is partly solved due to the leakage inductance. In addition, the magnetic integration technology is applied to improve the efficiency and to reduce the magnetic component size. Finally, a 48-V input 380-V output 1-kW prototype operating with 100-kHz switching frequency is built and tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed converter.},

abstract = {Multiphase converter topologies for use in high-performance applications have received increasing interest in recent years. This paper proposes a novel multidevice interleaved boost converter (MDIBC) that interfaces the fuel cell with the powertrain of hybrid electric vehicles. In this research, a multidevice structure with interleaved control is proposed to reduce the input current ripples, the output voltage ripples, and the size of passive components with high efficiency compared with the other topologies. In addition, low EMI and low stress in the switches are expected. The proposed dc/dc converter is compared to other converter topologies such as conventional boost converter (BC), multidevice boost converter (MDBC), and two-phase interleaved boost converter (IBC) to verify its dynamic performance. Furthermore, a generalized small-signal model is derived for these dc/dc converters, which has not been previously discussed. A digital dual-loop control is designed to achieve the proper regulator for the converters with fast transient response. The dc/dc converter topologies and their controller are designed and investigated by using MATLAB/Simulink. Finally, the proposed converter (MDIBC) is experimentally validated with results obtained from a 30-kW prototype that has been built and tested in our laboratory based on TMS320F2808 DSP. The simulation and experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed converter is more efficient than other dc/dc converter topologies in achieving high performance and reliability for high-power dc/dc converters.},

This approach came into focus recently with rapid development of electrochemical double-layer capacitors, so-called ultracapacitors.

abstract = {A soft-switching active snubber is proposed to reduce the turn-off losses of the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) in a buck power converter. The soft-switching snubber provides zero-voltage switching for the IGBT, thereby reducing its high turn-off losses due to the current tailing. The proposed snubber uses an auxiliary switch to discharge the snubber capacitor. This auxiliary switch also operates at zero-voltage and zero-current switching. The size of the auxiliary switch compared to the main switch makes this snubber a good alternative to the conventional snubber or even to passive low-loss snubbers. The use of the soft-switching active snubber permits the IGBT to operate at high frequencies with an improved RBSOA. In the experimental results reported for a 1 kW, 40 kHz prototype, combined switching/snubbing losses are reduced by 36{\%} through the use of the active snubber compared to a conventional RCD snubber. The use of an active snubber allows recovery of part of the energy stored in the snubber capacitor during turn-off. The generic snubber cell for the buck power converter is generalized to support the common nonisolated DC/DC power converters (buck, boost, buck-boost, Cuk, sepic, zeta) as well as isolated DC/DC power converters (forward, flyback, Cuk, and sepic)},

abstract = {Uncompensated friction forces compromise the positioning and tracking accuracy of motion systems. A unique tracking error known as quadrant glitch is the result of complex nonlinear friction behavior at motion reversal or near-zero velocity. Linear-feedback control strategies such as PID, cascade P/PI, or state-feedback control have to be extended with model- and nonmodel-based friction-compensation strategies to acquire sufficiently high path and tracking accuracy. This paper analyzes and validates experimentally three different friction-compensation strategies for a linear motor-based {\textless}i{\textgreater}xy{\textless}/i{\textgreater} feed drive of a high-speed milling machine: (1) friction-model-based feedforward; (2) an inverse-model-based disturbance observer; and (3) the combination of both techniques. The friction models considered are as follows: a simple static-friction model and the recently developed generalized Maxwell-slip (GMS) model. GMS friction-model-based feedforward combined with disturbance observer almost completely eliminates the radial tracking error and quadrant glitches.},

abstract = {An adaptive backstepping sliding mode controller, which combines both the merits of adaptive backstepping control and sliding mode control, is proposed to control the mover position of a linear induction motor (LIM) drive to compensate for the uncertainties including the friction force. First, the dynamic model of an indirect field-oriented LIM drive is derived. Then, a backstepping sliding mode approach is proposed to compensate the uncertainties which occur in the motion control system. The uncertainties are lumped, and the bound of the lumped uncertainty is necessary in the design of the backstepping sliding mode controller. However, the bound of the lumped uncertainty is difficult to obtain in advance in practical applications. Therefore, an adaptive law is derived to adapt the value of the lumped uncertainty in real-time, and an adaptive backstepping sliding mode control law is proposed. With the adaptive backstepping sliding mode controller, the mover position of the LIM drive possesses the advantages of good transient control performance and robustness to uncertainties for the tracking of periodic reference trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by both the simulated and experimental results},

In this paper the application of MTPO and MTTC to linear-motor-driven machines is examined. It is found that the attention paid to saturation limits by MTPO and MTTC strategies provides significant performance improvements for linear-motor-driven machines.

abstract = {Linear motors offer several advantages over their rotary counterparts in many precision manufacturing applications requiring linear motion; linear motors can achieve a much higher speed and have the potential of gaining a higher load positioning accuracy due to the elimination of mechanical transmission mechanisms. However, these advantages are obtained at the expense of added difficulties in controlling such a system. Specifically, linear motors are more sensitive to disturbances and parameter variations. Furthermore, certain types of linear motors such as the iron core are subject to significant nonlinear effects due to periodic cogging force and force ripple. To address all these issues, the recently proposed adaptive robust control (ARC) strategy is applied and a discontinuous projection-based ARC controller is constructed. In particular, based on the special structures of various periodic nonlinear forces, design models consisting of known basis functions with unknown weights are used to approximate those unknown nonlinear forces. On-line parameter adaptation is then utilized to reduce the effect of various parametric uncertainties such as unknown weights, inertia, and motor parameters while certain robust control laws are used to handle the uncompensated uncertain nonlinearities effectively for high performance. The resulting ARC controller achieves a guaranteed transient performance and a guaranteed final tracking accuracy in the presence of both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities. In addition, in the presence of parametric uncertainties, the controller achieves asymptotic output tracking. Extensive simulation results are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To meet growing demands for electric automotive and regenerative energy storage applications, researchers all over the world have sought to increase the energy density of electrochemical capacitors. Hybridizing battery-capacitor electrodes can overcome the energy density limitation of the conventional electrochemical capacitors because they employ both the system of a battery-like (redox) and a capacitor-like (double-layer) electrode, producing a larger working voltage and capacitance. However, to balance such asymmetric systems, the rates for the redox portion must be substantially increased to the levels of double-layer process, which presents a significant challenge. An in situ material processing technology called "ultracentrifuging (UC) treatment" has been used to prepare a novel ultrafast Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) nanocrystal electrode for capacitive energy storage. This Account describes an extremely high-performance supercapacitor that utilizes highly optimized "nano-nano-LTO/carbon composites" prepared via the UC treatment. The UC-treated LTO nanocrystals are grown as either nanosheets or nanoparticles, and both have hyperlinks to two types of nanocarbons: carbon nanofibers and supergrowth (single-walled) carbon nanotubes. The spinel structured LTO has been prepared with two types of hyperdispersed carbons. The UC treatment at 75 000G stoichiometrically accelerates the in situ sol-gel reaction (hydrolysis followed by polycondensation) and further forms, anchors, and grafts the nanoscale LTO precursors onto the carbon matrices. The mechanochemical sol-gel reaction is followed by a short heat-treatment process in vacuo. This immediate treatment with heat is very important for achieving optimal crystallization, inhibiting oxidative decomposition of carbon matrices, and suppressing agglomeration. Such nanocrystal composites can store and deliver energy at the highest rate attained to this date. The charge-discharge profiles indicate a very high sustained capacity of 80 mAh g(-1) at an extremely high rate of 1200 C. Using this ultrafast material, we assembled a hybrid device called a "nanohybrid capacitor" that consists of a Faradaic Li-intercalating LTO electrode and a non-Faradaic AC electrode employing an anion (typically BF4(-)) adsorption-desorption process. The "nanohybrid capacitor" cell has demonstrated remarkable energy, power, and cycleability performance as an electrochemical capacitor electrode. It also exhibits the same ion adsorption-desorption process rates as those of standard activated carbon electrodes in electrochemical capacitors. The new-generation "nanohybrid capacitor" technology produced more than triple the energy density of a conventional electrochemical capacitor. Moreover, the synthetic simplicity of the high-performance nanostructures makes it possible to scale them up for large-volume material production and further applications in many other electrochemical energy storage devices.},

abstract = {Several techniques to mitigate conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) in switch-mode power supplies (SMPS) have been reported in literature. Of these, this paper reviews those techniques that are primarily meant for ac-dc and dc-dc power converters. The techniques are broadly classified based on two criteria-1) reduction of the noise after generation and 2) reduction of the noise at the generation stage itself. A detailed classification and review of various noise mitigation techniques currently available in literature are presented. It is believed that the classification and review of the conducted EMI mitigation techniques presented in this paper would be useful to SMPS researchers and designers.},

abstract = {This paper presents a controller design methodology for machine tool direct feed drives. The methodology is applied to a linear motor (LM) and a piezoelectric actuator (PA). The structure of each plant model is obtained from physical laws and its parameters are obtained using system identification. A single transfer function (TF) model is shown to accurately predict the response of the LM. For the PA, multiple local models are required to accurately represent its dynamics. Next, a procedure for designing a model-based two degrees-of-freedom (2DOF) controller with anti-windup protection is presented for the single model and multiple model cases. With the LM, friction compensation, force ripple compensation and a disturbance observer are added to improve the tracking performance. Experimental results for both drives are included for step, ramp and sinusoidal reference inputs. For the LM, the rise time for a 1000 ??m step input is reduced from 25 to 3.5 ms in comparison to a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. For the PA, the rise time for a 10 ??m step is reduced from 6 to 1.5 ms. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A jet injector platform technology that provides improved performance over existing jet injectors through the use of a controllable linear Lorentz-force actuator and software-based control system has been developed. Injectors designed on this platform are capable of delivering injections using arbitrary pressure pulse shaping. Pulse shaping has been shown to allow a wide degree of control over the depth to which the injection is delivered. A software-based injector control system improves repeatability and allows for automatic reloading of the injector, a task that would be difficult to implement using existing jet injector platforms. A design for a prototype autoloading controllable jet injector (cJI) based on this platform is detailed. The injection capability of this cJI was evaluated both in-vitro and in-vivo using a tissue analog, excised porcine tissue, and ovine tissue. An analysis of the cJI's performance indicates that this design is capable of delivering a controllable volume of fluid to a controllable depth based entirely on the parameter's input into the control software.

abstract = {Actuator performance represents a key constraint on the capability of many engineered devices. Performance of these devices is often exceeded by their muscle-powered natural counterparts, inspiring the development of new, "active material" actuators. This thesis reconsiders a traditional actuator, the linear permanent magnet motor, as a form of active material actuator, and presents new, unified scaling and magnetic field models for its performance. This active material motor model predicts that motors composed of large numbers of very small, actively-cooled repeat units, similar to the architecture of biological muscles, can provide greatly enhanced force density over extant designs. Our model is constructed by considering the motor winding as an active material, with its performance limited by the diffusion of waste heat. This allows a quantitative scaling model for the motor constant and force-to-mass ratio to be built for the case of a winding immersed in a homogeneous magnetic field. This model is then modified with a small set of dimensionless parameters to describe the performance penalties imposed by the use of practical sources of magnetic field, specifically periodic arrays of permanent magnets. We explain how to calculate these parameters for a variety of different types of magnet arrays using analytical magnetic field and heat transfer models, and present a new field model for tubular linear motors having improved numerical stability and accuracy. We illustrate the use of our modeling approach with two design case studies, a motor for flapping-wing flying and an actuator for high-performance controllable needle-free jet injection. We then validate our predictions by building and testing a novel water-cooled motor using a tubular double-sided Halbach array of magnets, with a mass of 185 g, a stroke of 16 mm, and a magnetic repeat length of 14.5 mm. This motor generates a continuous force density of 140 N/kg, and has a motor constant of nearly 6 N/[square root]W, both higher than any previously reported motor in this size class.},

abstract = {Jet injectors are needleless injectors that penetrate skin with high-pressure fluid. They have potential advantages over needles and syringes in mass immunisation programs, but concerns over their capacity to transfer blood-borne viruses have been a barrier to acceptance. Hepatitis B infection can transmit in 10 pl of blood; detection of such low volumes presents severe difficulties to such assessments. A model to assess jet injector safety was developed using injection of an inert buffer into calves and assaying the next injector discharge, representing the next dose of vaccine, for blood using a highly sensitive ELISA. Four injectors were tested: two with reusable heads and direct skin contact, one with single-use injector heads and one where the injector head discharged at a distance from the skin. All injectors tested transmitted significant (over 10 pl) volumes of blood; the volumes and frequency of contamination varied with injector. The source of the contamination was consistent with contamination by efflux of injected fluid and blood from the pressurised pocket in tissue that is formed during injection. This insight should inform the design of safe jet injectors. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Medical jet injection, in which a narrow fluid drug stream is propelled into the skin without a needle, was first conceived in the 1940s [1]. However, a major drawback of most injectors is the lack of controllability of jet parameters. Recent work at the BioInstrumentation Laboratory at MIT has resulted in a tunable, high-performance linear Lorentz-force jet injector which allows for careful control of many injection variables. The sensor presented in this thesis further improves the ability to quantify and control contact forces between the injection nozzle and tissue. This sensor uses a three-spoke flexure system with full-bridge strain gauge assemblies mounted on each flexural arm to measure both normal and lateral forces applied to the nozzle. The design, fabrication, calibration, and validation for the sensor are detailed along with results for preliminary tissue injections into ex vivo porcine tissue. These preliminary tests showed higher percent volume delivery to the tissue with an elevated normal force. Under normal forces of 4 to 8 N, the BioInstrumentation Lab's jet injector achieved percent volume delivery of 89.1 5.1{\%}, whereas with normal forces of 0 to 4 N, the percent volume delivery was 68.9 t 12.7{\%}.},

abstract = {Many modern pharmaceutical therapies such as vaccines and macromolecular drugs benefit from transdermal delivery. Conventional transdermal drug delivery via hypodermic needles causes pain, non-compliance, and potential contamination. Alternative transdermal strategies that deliver drugs in a quick, reliable, painless, and inexpensive way are needed. Jet injectors, which deliver drugs through the skin using a high-speed stream of liquid propelled by compressed springs or gasses, provide a needle-free method of trandermal drug delivery. However, poor reliability as well as painful bruising and bleeding characterize these devices, due in part to the high and constant jet velocity with which drugs are delivered. Toward improved reliability and reduced pain, we have developed a jet injector capable of dynamic control of jet velocity during a single injection pulse. Using this device, we demonstrate that temporal control of jet velocity leads to independent control of penetration depth, by adjusting time at high velocity, and delivered dose, by adjusting time at low velocity, in model materials. This dynamic control of jet velocity creates the potential for better control of needle-free injections, as demonstrated through injection studies on whole ex vivo human skin samples. ?? 2009.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of a soluble insulin formulation was visualized and quantified in 3-dimensions using X-ray computed tomography. The drug distribution was visualized for ex vivo injections in pig subcutaneous tissue. Pig subcutaneous tissue has very distinct layers, which could be separated in the tomographic reconstructions and the amount of drug in each tissue class was quantified. With a scan time of about 45 min per sample, and a robust segmentation it was possible to analyze differences in the spatial drug distribution between several similar injections. It was studied how the drug distribution was effected by needle length, injection speed and injected volume. For an injected volume of 0.1 ml and injection depth of 8 mm about 50{\%} of the injections were partly intramuscular. Using a 5 mm needle resulted in purely subcutaneous injections with minor differences in the spatial drug distribution between injections. Increasing the injected volume from 0.1 ml to 1 ml did not increase the intramuscular volume fraction, but gave a significantly higher volume fraction placed in the fascia separating the deep and superficial subcutaneous fat layers. Varying the injection speed from 25 l/s up to 300 l/s gave no changes in the drug concentration distribution. The method presented gives novel insight into subcutaneous injections of soluble insulin drugs and can be used to optimize the injection technique for subcutaneous drug administration in preclinical studies of rodents.},

abstract = {Needle-free injection devices improve vaccinator safety and optimise vaccine delivery time by eliminating the use of needles involved with traditional vaccination techniques. Of significant importance is a full understanding of the relationships that exist between the injection properties and the depth and shape of the injectate's dispersion. Work has been done to characterise the distribution of human needle-free injection devices, but little research has been conducted on livestock injections, which operate at much higher pressures and volumes. Therefore, the aim of this research was to characterise the injection profile of a livestock needle-free injection device while varying the injection pressure and fluid volume and density. Water and porcine circovirus vaccine were injected into ballistic gelatin blocks and the injection mechanism was captured using high-speed photography. The volume was varied between 1.0 and 2.5 ml and orifice pressure between 40 and 220 MPa. It was found that pressure influenced the depth of penetration, but had little effect on the shape of the injection profile. In contrast, the volume and density increased the penetration depth and varied the dispersion pattern. These results can be used to better understand how the injection profile of a needle-free injection device changes given an initial set of parameters. This will be important for developing administration protocols that successfully deliver intradermal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular livestock injections.},

Aluminum electrolytic capacitor construction delivers colossal capacitance because etching the foils can increase surface area more than 100 times and the aluminum-oxide dielectric is less than a micrometer thick. Thus the resulting capacitor has very large plate area and the plates are intensely close together. These capacitors routinely offer capacitance values from 0.1 µF to 3 F and voltage ratings from 5 V to 550 V. Up to 700 V are commercially available. They are polar devices, having distinct positive and negative terminals, and are offered in an enormous variety of styles which include molded and can-style SMT devices, axial-and radial-leaded can styles, snap-in terminals styles and large-can, screw-terminal styles. Representative capacitance-voltage combinations include: 330 µF at 100 V and 6,800 µF at 10 V for SMT devices, 100 µF at 450 V, 6,800 µF at 50 V and 10,000 µF at 10 V for miniature-can styles, 1200 µF at 450 V and 39,000 µF at 50 V for snap-in can styles and 9000 µF at 450 V and 390,000 µF at 50 V for large-can, screw-terminal styles. If two, same-value, aluminum electrolytic capacitors are connected in series with the positive terminals or the negative terminals connected together, the resulting single capacitor is a non-polar capacitor with half the capacitance. The two capacitors rectify the applied voltage and act as if they had been bypassed by diodes. When voltage is applied, the correct-polarity capacitor gets the full voltage. In non-polar aluminum electrolytic capacitors and motor-start aluminum electrolyte capacitors a second anode foil substitutes for the cathode foil to achieve a non-polar capacitor in a single case.},

Force-to-volume ratio of different motor design solutions are compared considering the effect of motor dimensions and permanent magnet materials (ferrite and NdFeB). A finite element analysis is used to validate the results obtained from the analytical model, comparing the magnetic field quantities as well as the mechanical force.

abstract = {We provide a mathematical analysis for the appearance of motor effects, i.e., the concentration (as Dirac masses) at one side of the domain, for the solution of a Fokker-Planck system with two components, one with an asymmetric potential and diffusion and one with pure diffusion. The system has been proposed as a model for motor proteins moving along molecular filaments. Its components describe the densities of different conformations of proteins. Contrary to the case with two asymmetric potentials, the case at hand requires a large number of periods in order for the motor effect to occur. It is therefore posed as a homogenization problem where the diffusion length is at the same scale as the period of the potential. Our approach is based on the analysis of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation arising, at the zero diffusion limit, after an exponential transformation of the phase functions. The homogenization procedure yields an effective Hamiltonian whose properties are closely related to the concentration phenomena. ?? 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

The simulation results of the proposed method are then compared with both of the experimental measurements detected on the experimental setup, and another 3D FEA old model.

The analytical model has been also used to implement a dynamic model of the whole system in the Matlab/Simulink/Plecs simulation environment.

abstract = { In this paper, a new active clamping current-fed half-bridge converter has been proposed, which is suitable for fuel cell based power generation systems. The proposed converter has outstanding advantages over the conventional dc-dc converters with respect to high efficiency, high power density, and high component utilization. In special, the proposed converter has predominant high boosting output voltage and high efficiency characteristics under the inherently severe low output voltage of the fuel cell through the overall load conditions. Moreover, the developed converter has been experimentally tested with the help of a fuel cell simulator, which is developed by Sungkyunkwan Univ. and can generate the V-I characteristics of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), so that the performance of the proposed converter could be effectively examined and the validity of the converter could be verified.},

Meanwhile, the strong coupling and nonlinearity of LSRMs and drives make it very difficult to derive a comprehensive mathematical model for the behavior of the system. This paper presents a new excitation winding configuration to improve the power density and proposes a new method to model the LSRM and drive based on the matrix and tensor approach.

abstract = {Release-launch is a fundamental operation in space platform. Not like traditional land-base launcher, space-base launcher is more flexible and more efficient. Tubular linear electromagnetic launcher (TLEML), which provides higher force density, simple structure and no unilateral magnetic force, compared with the flat linear electromagnetic launcher, is more suitable for space platform. It can easily meet the demand such as little volume, light weight and high control precision. This paper analyzes and optimizes the thrust characteristics of tubular linear permanent magnet synchronous motors (TL-PMSM) for electromagnetic launcher, including different topologies, interior permanent magnet (IPM) and surface-mounted permanent magnet (SPM). First, build up the finite element model for the two kinds of TLEML and calculate the magnetic field. Then thrust force fluctuation figures are obtained by finite element analysis considering the pole/arc ratio, the pole pitch and the inner diameter/outer diameter ratio of the stator. The result shows that it can improve the thrust characteristic and decrease the cogging force by optimizing the parameters of the motor.},

Then, we used 2-D finite-element analysis to illustrate the performance variation of LPMMs caused by the variation of structure parameters. Computer simulation results show that the characteristics and dimensions of the PMs, the shapes and dimensions of the armature, and the exciting current all have significant effects on motor performance. Several design examples based on the effects of these parameters demonstrate the design of the LPMMs. The design consideration presented in this paper can be used to determine preliminary LPMM mechanical structures before hardware implementation.},

Although various identification and compensation schemes haven been reported for the PMLM, to the authors' best knowledge, no direct and unified modeling method for force ripples and friction is available till now. This paper proposes a new method to identify various linear and nonlinear parameters in PMLM, using a hysteretic relay feedback. Dual-input describing functions are imported to leverage on the biased limit cycles generated by even nonlinearities due to force ripple. The explicit formulae, derived from the harmonic balance condition, enable direct computation of model parameters with a minimum number of relay experiments. Simulation results and real-time experiments will be presented to verify the practical appeal of proposed method in precision motion control.},

abstract = {The paper describes an analytical technique for pre- dicting the eddy-current loss in the moving armature of a tubular permanent magnet machine. This loss component is usually ne- glected in conventional tubular permanentmagnet machines since high-order time harmonics in the stator current waveform and space harmonics in the winding magnetomotive force (MMF) dis- tribution are generally considered to be insignificant. However, a relatively new topology of tubular permanent magnet machine, sometimes referred to as “modular,” has emerged in which the fundamental component of the stator MMF has fewer poles than that of the permanent-magnet armature, the thrust force being de- veloped by the interaction between a higher orderMMFharmonic and the permanent magnet field. Thus, the presence of lower and higher order space harmonics in the windingMMFdistribution of amodular machinemay gives rise to a significant eddy-current loss in themoving-magnet armature. An analyticalmodel is developed to predict the eddy currents which are induced in the magnets, as well as inany electrically conducting supporting tube whichmay be employed, and to quantify the effectiveness of axially segmenting the magnets in reducing the eddy-current loss. The validity of the developed model, which is also applicable to conventional designs of tubular permanent-magnet machine, is verified by time-stepped transient finite-element analysis (FEA).},

abstract = { Whilst methods of determining the iron loss in rotating permanent magnet machines have been investigated extensively, the study of iron loss in linear machines is relatively poorly documented. This paper describes a simple analytical method to predict flux density waveforms in discrete regions of the laminated stator of a tubular permanent magnet machine, and employs an established iron loss model to determine the iron loss components, on both no-load and on-load. Analytical predictions are compared with the iron loss deduced from finite element analyses for two tubular permanent magnet machine designs, and it is shown that if a machine has a relatively high electrical loading, the on-load iron loss can be significantly higher than the no-load value.},

@article{Smadi2012,
abstract = {Safety issue is a great concern for rehabilitation robots that are expected to contribute to future aging society. Appropriate compliance is required for their joints. However, combination of servomotors and high-ratio gears, such as harmonic gears, makes the joint of robots nonbackdrivable. The nonbackdrivability causes lack of adaptability and safety. On the other hand, conventional direct-drive systems, including linear motors, are relatively big for such application. This paper presents the development and analysis of compact high-backdrivable direct-drive linear actuator. The motor consists of a helical structure stator and mover. The mover does not contact the stator and moves helically in the stator under a proper magnetic levitation control. Thus, the motor realizes direct-drive motion without mechanical gears. Decoupling control is proposed and integrated with disturbance observer to achieve robustness against model uncertainties and input disturbance. The main contribution of this paper is to experimentally realize the direct-drive feature of the helical motor.},

@article{Yao2010,
abstract = {The ever increasingly stringent performance requirements of modern mechanical systems have forced control engineers to look beyond traditional linear control theory for more advanced nonlinear controllers. During the past decade, a mathematically rigorous nonlinear adaptive robust control (ARC) theory has been developed and has been experimentally demonstrated achieving significant performance improvement in a number of motion control applications. This plenary paper first uses a simple motion control problem as an example to bring out the conceptual connection and nonlinear extension of the widely used PID controller structure to the developed ARC approach. Through this example, some of the key underlying working mechanisms of the ARC theory can be grasped easily. The paper then highlights how major issues in the precision motion control can be handled systematically and effectively with the ARC framework. The issues considered include (i) large variations of physical parameters of a system; (ii) unknown nonlinearities such as cogging and ripple forces of linear motors; (iii) dynamic uncertain nonlinearities with non-uniformly detectable unmeasured internal states (e.g., friction described by dynamic models in high precision motion controls); and (iv) control input saturation due to limited capacity of physical actuators. The precision motion control of a linear motor driven high-speed/high-acceleration industrial gantry is used as a case study and comparative experimental results are presented to illustrate the achievable performance and limitations of various ARC controllers in implementation.},

abstract = {In this paper, the improved active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method is discussed firstly. This method is applied to the high precision positioning table, which is driven by the voice coil motor (VCM). Compared with the conventional ADRC, the proposed ADRC has been improved for its tracking differentiator (TD) is replaced by the reference trajectory optimization (RTO), which is based on 5 order S-shaped curve (FOS). An extended state observer (ESO) of the ADRC can observe disturbances and uncertainties of the system, and cancel them dynamically. Secondly, the hybrid cascaded H-bridge (HCHB) seven-level inverter topology structure is proposed to make sure that the current could possess high power and low ripple at the same time. However, the HCHB inverter has its own drawback that its current flows backwards in it. Therefore, the hybrid frequency carrier-based PWM (HFPWM) modulation method is put forward to solve this problem. Thirdly, the mathematical model of VCM is established accurately, which takes the air damping, eddy current damping and elastic stiffness into consideration. Finally, the experimental and simulation results show that the improved ADRC control method can effectively improve positioning accuracy and robustness; the FOS curve can reduce the impact of shocks and residual vibration; the HCHB inverter resolves the contradiction between high power and low ripple.},

abstract = {A general framework for the analysis and design of a class of tubular linear permanent magnet machines is described. The open-circuit and armature reaction magnetic field distributions are established analytically in terms of a magnetic vector potential and cylindrical coordinate formulation, and the results are validated extensively by comparison with finite element analyses. The analytical field solutions allow the prediction of the thrust force, the winding emf, and the self- and mutual-winding inductances in closed forms. These facilitate the characterization of tubular machine topologies and provide a basis for comparative studies, design optimization, and machine dynamic modeling. Some practical issues, such as the effects of slotting and fringing, have also been accounted for and validated by measurements.},

abstract = {The replacement of steam catapults with electromagnetic ones is becoming an overwhelming trend in aircraft launch systems. Recently, the double-sided linear launcher has attracted more and more attention from researchers. This paper presents the design and analysis of the moving-magnet-type permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM). The thrust density is the most important indicator for a powerful motor, so an analytical expression of the thrust-density coefficient is derived from basic electromagnetic force laws. Based on the analytical results, the thrust and the thrust ripple are analyzed using the finite element method in different conditions. In order to modularize easily, the ring windings have been applied in the double-sided PMLSM, and then, the design features and parameter optimization of the windings are discussed. This paper can provide references to select the suitable type of motor for the launch systems and accomplish the fundamental work for the design of a prototype.},

abstract = {As the contribution of electricity generated from renewable sources (wind, wave and solar) grows, the inherent intermittency of supply from such generating technologies must be addressed by a step-change in energy storage. Furthermore, the continuously developing demands of contemporary applications require the design of versatile energy-storage/power supply systems offering wide ranges of power density and energy density. As no single energy-storage technology has this capability, systems will comprise combinations of technologies such as electrochemical supercapacitors, flow batteries, lithium-ion batteries, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and kinetic energy storage. The evolution of the electrochemical supercapacitor is largely dependent on the development of optimised electrode materials (tailored to the chosen electrolyte) and electrolytes. Similarly, the development of lithium-ion battery technology requires fundamental research in materials science aimed at delivering new electrodes and electrolytes. Lithium-ion technology has significant potential, and a step-change is required in order to promote the technology from the portable electronics market into high-duty applications. Flow-battery development is largely concerned with safety and operability. However, opportunities exist to improve electrode technology yielding larger power densities. The main barriers to overcome with regard to the development of SMES technology are those related to high-temperature superconductors in terms of their granular, anisotropic nature. Materials development is essential for the successful evolution of flywheel technology. Given the appropriate research effort, the key scientific advances required in order to successfully develop energy-storage technologies generally represent realistic goals that may be achieved by 2050. ?? 2008 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.},

Moreover, the rapid development of power electronics technologies has even realized high energy-efficient vehicles. EV could be the alternative to decrease the global green house gases emission as the energy consumption in the world transportation is high. However, EV faces huge challenges in battery cost since one-third of the EV cost lies on battery. This paper reviews state-of-the-art of the energy sources, storage devices, power converters, low-level control energy management strategies and high supervisor control algorithms used in EV. The comparison on advantages and disadvantages of vehicle technology is highlighted. In addition, the standards and patterns of drive cycles for EV are also outlined. The advancement of power electronics and power processors has enabled sophisticated controls (low-level and high supervisory algorithms) to be implemented in EV to achieve optimum performance as well as the realization of fast-charging stations. The rapid growth of EV has led to the integration of alternative resources to the utility grid and hence smart grid control plays an important role in managing the demand.

abstract = {There is much confusion and uncertainty in the literature concerning the useable power capability of batteries and ultracapacitors (electrochemical capacitors) for various applications. Clarification of this confusion is one of the primary objectives of this paper. The three approaches most often applied to determine the power capability of devices are (1) matched impedance power, (2) the min/max method of the USABC, and (3) the pulse energy efficiency approach used at UC Davis. It has been found that widely different power capability for batteries and ultracapacitors can be inferred using these approaches even when the resistance and open-circuit voltage are accurately known. In general, the values obtained using the energy efficiency method for EF = 90-95{\%} are much lower than the other two methods which yield values corresponding to efficiencies of 70-75{\%}. For plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicle applications, the maximum useable power density for a lithium-ion battery can be higher than that corresponding to 95{\%} efficiency because the peak power of the driveline is used less frequently and consequently charge/discharge efficiently is less important. For these applications, the useable power density of the batteries can be closer to the useable power density of ultracapacitors. In all cases, it is essential that a careful and appropriate measurement is made of the resistance of the devices and the comparisons of the useable power capability be made in a way appropriate for the application for which the devices are to be used. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Based on this pro- cedure, three converter topologies—a phase-shift converter with current doubler and with capacitive output filter and a series– parallel resonant converter—are optimized with respect to power density for a telecom supply (400 V/48 V). There, the characteris- tic of the power density, the efficiency, and the volume distribution between the components as functions of frequency are discussed. For the operating points with maximal power density, the loss distribution is also presented. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the optimum with respect to junction temperature, cooling, and core material is investigated. The highest power density is achieved by the series–parallel resonant converter. For a 5-kW supply, a den- sity of approximately 12 kW/L and a switching frequency of ca. 130 kHz are obtained.},

abstract = {The source voltage of high-power fuel cell shows strong load dependence at comparatively low voltage levels. In order to provide the voltage of 750V on the DC-link for feeding electrical energy into the mains via a three phase inverter a step-up converter with a large step-up ratio is required. The output voltage of this DC/DC-converter must be stabile during variations of the load current and the voltage of the fuel cell. This paper presents the methods and results of the calculation of the efficiency and the expense for the realization for the circuits of the DC/DC-converter that meet these requirements.},

Low-input-voltage sources include single fuel cells, single solar cells, and thermoelectric devices. The primary context is interfacing single micro fuel cells to portable electronic loads, such as mobile phones. Efficiency and circuit startup are the two most difficult issues for a low-cost design. It is shown in theory and experiment that the boost converter has a voltage collapse point. A simple startup technique is proposed that is appropriate for some applications.},

abstract = {The penetration of renewable sources (particularly wind power) in to the power system network has been increasing in the recent years. As a result of this, there have been serious concerns over reliable and satisfactory operation of the power systems. One of the solutions being proposed to improve the reliability and performance of these systems is to integrate energy storage devices into the power system network. Further, in the present deregulated markets these storage devices could also be used to increase the profit margins of wind farm owners and even provide arbitrage. This paper discusses the present status of battery energy storage technology and methods of assessing their economic viability and impact on power system operation. Further, a discussion on the role of battery storage systems of electric hybrid vehicles in power system storage technologies had been made. Finally, the paper suggests a likely future outlook for the battery technologies and the electric hybrid vehicles in the context of power system applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Nymand2010,
abstract = {A new design approach achieving very high conversion efficiency in low-voltage high-power isolated boost dc-dc converters is presented. The transformer eddy-current and proximity effects are analyzed, demonstrating that an extensive interleaving of primary and secondary windings is needed to avoid high winding losses. The analysis of transformer leakage inductance reveals that extremely low leakage inductance can be achieved, allowing stored energy to be dissipated. Power MOSFETs fully rated for repetitive avalanches allow primary-side voltage clamp circuits to be eliminated. The oversizing of the primary-switch voltage rating can thus be avoided, significantly reducing switch-conduction losses. Finally, silicon carbide rectifying diodes allow fast diode turn-off, further reducing losses. Detailed test results from a 1.5-kW full-bridge boost dc-dc converter verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate very high conversion efficiency. The efficiency at minimum input voltage and maximum power is 96.8{\%}. The maximum efficiency of the proposed converter is 98{\%}.},

Based on the analysis, in the proposed topology, only 30.7{\%} power of the total PV system is needed for a dc/dc converter. Furthermore, the dc/dc converter efficiency curve is flat under wide PV module voltage and all load ranges. In particular, the converter efficiency at the lower duty range is dramatically improved. The total PV system is implemented for a 250-kW PV power conditioning system (PCS). This system has only three dc/dc converters with a 25-kW power rating. It is only one-third of the total PV PCS power. The 25-kW prototype PV dc/dc converter is introduced to experimentally verify the proposed topology. In addition, an experimental result shows that the proposed topology exhibits a good performance.},

abstract = {Lithium ion capacitors (LICs) were assembled using pre-lithiated graphite anode and activated carbon (AC) cathode. The cells were tested for their rate capability at 1 C and 10 C for 100 and 600 cycles, respectively at two different cut-off voltages. The cell delivered a discharge energy density of 55 Wh kg -1 (active materials basis) over the potential range of 3.1-4.1 V and 100 Wh kg -1 in the extended cut-off potential of 2.0-4.1 V. The maximum energy density obtained with LIC is about 8 times higher than the energy density obtainable with conventional EDLCs that operates in a voltage window of 0.0-2.5 V. The capacity fade of LIC with cycling is directly correlated with the reduced utilisation of the positive AC material during the charge storage process, which in turn, is caused by the instability of the pre-lithiated graphite negative electrode. The instability of the pre-lithiated graphite electrode resulted in the self-discharge of pre-doped Li, which is believed to be the result of a poorly formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on graphite surface. Li pre-doping methodology is shown to play a crucial role and contributes to the stability of the negative electrode and consequently the cell cycling stability.},

abstract = {High power electrical energy storage systems are becoming critical devices for advanced energy storage technology. This is true in part due to their high rate capabilities and moderate energy densities which allow them to capture power efficiently from evanescent, renewable energy sources. High power systems include both electrochemical capacitors and electrostatic capacitors. These devices have fast charging and discharging rates, supplying energy within seconds or less. Recent research has focused on increasing power and energy density of the devices using advanced materials and novel architectural design. An increase in understanding of structure-property relationships in nanomaterials and interfaces and the ability to control nanostructures precisely has led to an immense improvement in the performance characteristics of these devices. In this review, we discuss the recent advances for both electrochemical and electrostatic capacitors as high power electrical energy storage systems, and propose directions and challenges for the future. We asses the opportunities in nanostructure-based high power electrical energy storage devices and include electrochemical and electrostatic capacitors for their potential to open the door to a new regime of power energy.},

abstract = {A high-efficiency fuel cell power conditioning system with input current ripple reduction is proposed. The proposed system consists of a high-efficiency high-step-up current-fed resonant push-pull converter and a full-bridge inverter. The converter conserves inherent advantages of a conventional current-fed push-pull converter such as low input-current stress and high voltage conversion ratio. Also, a voltage-doubler rectifier is employed in order to remove the reverse-recovery problem of the output rectifying diodes and provide much higher voltage conversion ratio. The current ripple reduction control without an external component is suggested. Therefore, the proposed system operates in a wide input-voltage range with a high efficiency. By using a current-ripple reduction control, the input current ripple is furthermore reduced. A 1.5-kW prototype is implemented with input-voltage range from 30 to 70 V. Experimental results show that minimum efficiency at full load is about 92.5{\%} and that ripple current is less than 2{\%} of the rated input current.},

@article{bommanan1992,
abstract = {Previous attempts to use ultrasound (less than or equal to 1-MHz frequency and 1 to 3-W/cm2 intensity) to enhance transdermal drug delivery (so-called sonophoresis) have produced inconsistent results. Theoretical analysis of ultrasound propagation in tissue predicts that higher-frequency ultrasound (greater than 1 MHz) will increase the concentration of energy deposition in the stratum corneum (SC) (typically, the rate-limiting barrier to percutaneous penetration). This hypothesis was tested by comparing the passive transdermal delivery of salicylic acid with that under the influence of ultrasound at 2-, 10-, and 16-MHz frequency; measurements were performed in vivo in hairless guinea pigs. Total drug absorbed was quantified by determining the amount of salicylic acid (1) present in SC tape strips and (2) eliminated in urine. Sonophoresis for 20 min at 2 MHz caused no significant increase in salicylic acid delivery over passive diffusion; treatment with ultrasound at 10 and 16 MHz, on the other hand, significantly elevated salicylic acid transport, by 4-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. Kinetic analysis of the sonophoretic data at 10 and 16 MHz also revealed that the diffusion lag time associated with transdermal drug delivery (TDD) was reduced. A shorter period (5 min) of sonophoresis again resulted in enhanced TDD (relative to the corresponding control) at the higher frequencies; the delivered dose, and the level of enhancement, however, were lower than those after the 20-min treatment.},

This report discusses the use of a controllable Lorentz-force actuated needle-free injector to deliver a blend of bacterial collagenases to the skin. Drug ejected/injected using a preprogrammed pressure vs time profile through a 100 or 200 microm orifice showed activity comparable to that observed following ejection/injection using a conventional syringe as determined by a solution based fluorescence assay and zymography. In a live animal trial, necrosis, hair loss, and minimal bruising were observed at drug injected sites regardless of the delivery mode as were changes in tissue morphology.},

abstract = {Needle free injection systems are innovative ways to introduce a variety of medicines in patients without piercing the skin with a traditional needle. These systems work by the mechanism in which liquid medication is forced at an elevated speed through a small orifice that is held against the skin. Due to this an ultrafine stream of high pressure fluid is created, that penetrates the skin devoid of the use of a needle, thus faster administration of drug occurs as compared to conventional needles. Needle free systems are designed to solve the problems created due to conventional needles making them safer, less expensive, and more suitable. It is expected that these systems will augment the rate of vaccination and reduce the amount of antibiotics prescribed. Moreover, they should decrease the occurrence of needle stick accidents that have been seen in some health care workers contracting diseases. Today, they are an increasingly rising technology that promises the administration of medicine efficient with reduction of pain. Companies are not only working on developing technologies that are safer and easier to use, but also on alternatives which can deliver more types of medicines.},

Until very recently, all jet injectors utilized force- and pressure-generating principles that progress injection in an uncontrolled manner with limited ability to regulate delivery volume and injection depth. In order to address these shortcomings, we have developed a controllable jet injection device, based on a custom high-stroke linear Lorentz-force motor that is feed-back controlled during the time-course of an injection. Using this device, we are able to monitor and modulate continuously the speed of the drug jet, and regulate precisely the volume of drug delivered during the injection process. We demonstrate our ability to control injection depth (up to 16. mm) and repeatably and precisely inject volumes of up to 250. ??L into transparent gels and post-mortem animal tissue. ?? 2011 IPEM.},

Injectors designed on this platform are capable of delivering injections using arbitrary pressure pulse shaping. Pulse shaping has been shown to allow a wide degree of control over the depth to which the injection is delivered. A software-based injector control system improves repeatability and allows for automatic reloading of the injector, a task that would be difficult to implement using existing jet injector platforms. A design for a prototype autoloading controllable jet injector (cJI) based on this platform is detailed. The injection capability of this cJI was evaluated both in-vitro and in-vivo using a tissue analog, excised porcine tissue, and ovine tissue. An analysis of the cJI's performance indicates that this design is capable of delivering a controllable volume of fluid to a controllable depth based entirely on the parameter's input into the control software.

We use the model to predict the jet speed achieved during an injection. The model simulates the electrical response of the motor coil, the mechanical response of the drug piston and ampoule and the friction incident upon the piston during the time course of the injection. High-speed video measurements of piston movement in response to a step input show that the model predicts piston-tip position during an injection within an RMS error of 287 m. The corresponding jet speed is predicted to be 180 ms(-1) with a maximum overshoot to 205 ms(-1).},

Though syringe jet injectors have been in use for almost 50 years, current designs still suffer from inconsistent performance. To better understand the fluid mechanics of jet injection and gain insight into how the design might influence performance, two theoretical analyses to determine the fluid pressure profile at the exit orifice were conducted. The first was a continuum analysis assuming static incompressibility. Results demonstrated that the maximum jet pressure was highly sensitive to the spring constant, initial piston velocity, and piston cross-sectional area while the time to achieve the maximum pressure was most sensitive to the injection chamber length, initial piston velocity, bulk modulus of the injectant, and the piston cross-sectional area. The second analysis was a shock wave analysis. Results demonstrated a stepwise pressure-time plot that was similar in magnitude to that for the continuum analysis assuming static incompressibility. Results from these two investigations are useful for design modification of the jet injector to achieve desired pressure-time profiles at the orifice. Control of pressure-time profiles may help to achieve a more consistent and effective injection process.},

abstract = {After someone swallows a medicine, the chemical must traverse a veritable maze. It has to survive a journey through the stomach and reach the intestines intact before crossing the intestinal wall into circulation. Once in the blood, it gets filtered through the liver before it can travel to the rest of the body. At each "way station," the compound must resist the acids of digestive juices, jump membrane barriers or fend off enzymes designed to chop it into useless bits. Pharmaceutical makers have come up with various solutions to help certain medicines on the market today surpass these obstacles; however, these approaches do not work for many other drugs. One strategy, for instance, coats pills with a shell that is insoluble in stomach secretions but that dissolves readily once it hits the more alkaline environment of the small intestine. But if a drug is made of protein--as most agents produced using biotechnology are--it also has to evade the activity of protein destroying enzymes called proteases. Packaging pills with their own bodyguards (in this case, molecules called protease inhibitors) could enable protein based drugs to survive, but it would not aid them in crossing the gut lining; they are too big to slip into the blood as easily as more typical drugs, which generally consist of small molecules. Coatings also have a limited ability to control a drug's pharmacokinetics--the rate at which it enters circulation and the time it persists in the body's tissues and organs. A drug can be toxic if it gets into the bloodstream too quickly at high concentrations or if it sticks around too long; conversely, it can be ineffective if a protracted delay occurs before it begins circulating.},

abstract = {A high population of dendritic cells in the skin makes intradermal (ID) immunization an attractive route. We sought to further enhance immune responses from a previously reported novel nanoparticle-based DNA vaccine delivery system by administering the system intradermally into mouse skin using Biojector{\textregistered} 2000, a needle-free jet injection device. Two mouse studies were carried out. Balb/C mice (n=5-6) were immunized on day 0, 7, and 14 by subcutaneous injection or via the Biojector{\textregistered} 2000 with pDNA alone (CMV-$\beta$-galactosidase, 5 $\mu$g), pDNA-coated nanoparticles, or $\beta$-galactosidase protein (10 $\mu$g) adjuvanted with 'Alum' (15 $\mu$g). On day 28, mice were sacrificed and specific serum IgG and IgA titer, in vitro cytokine release, and cell proliferation of isolated splenocytes were determined. Similar to previous reports, in both mouse studies, SC immunization with pDNA-coated nanoparticles led to over a log increase in specific serum IgG titer as compared to immunization with pDNA alone. For pDNA alone, jet and SC injection did not result in significant differences in IgG titer. In contrast, for pDNA-coated nanoparticles, jet injection led to as high as a 20-fold enhancement in IgG titer over SC injection. In addition, jet injection of pDNA-coated nanoparticles enhanced the IgG titer by more than 200-fold over jet injection of pDNA alone. Also, jet injection of pDNA-coated nanoparticles resulted in significantly enhanced specific serum IgA titer. For in vitro cytokine release, immunization with pDNA-coated nanoparticles by jet injection enhanced IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-4 release over pDNA alone by 6- and 5-fold, respectively. SC injection of pDNA-coated nanoparticles also resulted in enhanced IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-4 release over pDNA alone although with less magnitude. Finally, immunization with pDNA-coated nanoparticles, by both jet injection and SC injection, led to improved splenocyte proliferation over pDNA alone. In conclusion, a combination of a novel cationic nanoparticle-based DNA delivery system with ID jet injection led to enhanced antibody production, Th-1/Th-2 balanced cytokine release, and enhanced splenocyte proliferation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, macromolecular drug delivery across the skin is primarily accomplished using hypodermic needles, which have several disadvantages including accidental needle-sticks, pain and needle phobia. These limitations have led to extensive research and development of alternative methods for drug and vaccine delivery across the skin. This review focuses on the recent trends and developments in this field of micro-scale devices for transdermal macromolecular delivery. These include liquid jet injectors, powder injectors, microneedles and thermal microablation. The historical perspective, mechanisms of action, important design parameters, applications and challenges are discussed for each method. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {Lateral transmission of blood-borne diseases can occur when a single needle is used repeatedly to vaccinate livestock. Needle-free technology to vaccinate sheep without damaging the carcass, causing lesions, or leaving needle fragments, and eliciting a similar antibody response as traditional needle vaccinations, has been hampered due to variable wool length. Vaccine delivery, injection time, and antibody response were evaluated for a prototype pneumatically powered, needle-free injector and for traditional needle injections. To determine optimal pressure for vaccine delivery with the pneumatic, needle-free injector, two 8-mo-old wethers were injected at pressures from 207 to 414 kPa in increments of 69 kPa. Injection time and antibody responses were evaluated using one hundred 8-mo-old wethers given primary and secondary inoculations of ovalbumin. Serum samples were collected before and after the inoculations on d 0, 14, 28, and 42. Optimal pressure to deliver a s.c. inoculation with the pneumatic, needle-free injector was 207 to 276 pKa. Inoculation of 100 wethers required 60{\%} less time with the pneumatic, needle-free injector than with needle injections when a new needle was used on every animal. Antibody titers were the same (P {\textgreater} 0.12) for the pneumatic, needle-free and the needle injections on d 14, 28, and 42. In addition, antibody titers increased after primary and secondary inoculations, as expected. This study indicated that a pneumatic, needle-free injector can be used to elicit the same antibody response in sheep as a needle injection, and the pneumatic, needle-free injector was faster. The pneumatic, needle-free injector also would be expected to reduce lateral transmission of blood-borne diseases, and will save time, eliminate biohazard waste (e.g., used needles), and eliminate accidental needle sticks for livestock handlers when vaccinating sheep.},

The novel design of this prototype makes multiple jet-injections possible. Therefore, repeated jet-injections into one target tissue can be performed easily. This jet-injector hand-held system was used for the direct in vivo gene transfer of plasmid DNA into tumors to achieve efficient expression of reporter genes (beta-galactosidase, green fluorescent protein [GFP]) and of therapeutic genes (TNF-alpha) in different tumor models. The study presented here revealed the key parameters of efficient in vivo jet-injection (jet-injection volume, pressure, jet penetration, DNA stability) to define the optimal conditions for a jet-injection-aided nonviral gene therapy.},

abstract = {Percutaneous vaccine delivery offers an advantageous mode of immunization due to the unique ability of cutaneous immune cells, especially Langerhans cells, to present antigens to the immune system. Langerhans cells, upon activation, migrate to the regional lymph nodes and lead to the generation of systemic and mucosal immune responses. However, simple topical application of vaccines does not deliver sufficient amounts of antigen in the skin to generate an adequate immune response. Co-administration of strong adjuvants such as cholera toxin or invasive skin abrasion is usually necessary to induce an adequate immune response by topical vaccine application. Here, we report on the use of low-frequency ultrasound as a potent physical adjuvant for successful transcutaneous immunization (TCI). Using tetanus toxoid as a model vaccine, we show that low-frequency ultrasound enhances the immune response induced by topical application of tetanus toxoid. The adjuvant effect of ultrasound is partly explained by the enhanced delivery of tetanus toxoid into the skin after ultrasound application and partly by the activation of immune cells after ultrasonic TCI. These studies demonstrate generation of a potent systemic immune response through TCI without using toxin adjuvants or skin abrasion. Ultrasonic TCI offers a needle-free and painless mode of immunization. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Introduction: Type A hepatitis virus (HAV) is a serious health problem throughout the world and can be spread via fecal-oral contact. Both immune globulin and an HAV vaccine provide protection, but the vaccine gives complete protection. Efficacy of methods of vaccination in relation to the formation of anti-HAV antibodies is unclear; thus, this study seeks to determine if significant differences exist between the syringe as compared to the jet injection technique. The purpose of this study was to compare in a randomized trial Biojet jet-injection system to a needle-syringe method. To determine if a significant difference between these two methods in seroconversion rates or geometric mean titers of anti HAV antibody occurs at day 15, 30, and 210 days after vaccination. Method: Anti-HAV IgG(-) adult hospital employees were randomized to receive 1440 EL.U of hepatitis a vaccine (HAVRIX??) in 2 doses by either needle or jet-injector (Biojector??) system at month 0 and 6. HAV seroconversion titer results were measured by the Boehringer-Mannheim method. Results/discussion: A higher proportion of persons who received HAV vaccine via the Biojector?? seroconverted with anti- HAV level ???20 mIU at day 15, 30, and month 7 when compared with a needle injection. Side-effect profiles reported by participants in both methods were below those identified in current published and insert information, but the Biojector?? had greater local reactivity in all categories when compared to the needle method.

The discharge characteristics of the liquid jet were measured using a custom-built test instrument. The experiments reveal that a high-speed liquid jet penetrates a soft solid by the formation and opening of a planar crack. The fluid stagnation pressure required for skin penetration decreases with increasing diameter of the liquid jet. These findings are consistent with the slow-speed penetration of a soft solid by a sharp-tipped punch. It is demonstrated that the Shergold-Fleck sharp-tipped punch penetration model [Shergold, O.A., Fleck, N.A., 2004. Mechanisms of deep penetration of soft solids. Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond.

This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of this device in the hands of experienced jet injection users in a home environment. Diabetic subjects currently using a needle-free device for the administration of their insulin were studied. Subjects used the new Medi-Jector Vision for all of their insulin administration during the course of the study. Insulin was injected on schedule and at doses consistent with their standard of practice as directed by their health care provider. All subjects were required to document each injection in a daily diary. Study subjects utilized all common insulin types (rapid, regular, intermediate, and long acting), and injections were administered in all of the common injection sites (arms, thighs, abdomen, and buttocks). Once subjects optimized the system to the most appropriate orifice size based on completeness of injection, average completeness percentages were greater than 94{\%} for all orifice sizes. Most patients using the new Medi-Jector Vision in the home were able to manage their insulin therapy without significant complication. We conclude that the jet delivery of insulin with the new Medi-Jector Vision is well accepted by people with diabetes and offers a reliable alternative to the use of needles.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development and utilization of novel needle-free injection devices in order to minimize needle stick injuries make increasing demands for suitable assay systems, which reflect the physiological situation in humans as close as possible. OBJECTIVES: It was therefore the goal of the present study to test the biological performance of a needle-free injector (INJEX) by the use of porcine skin as a model with a high predictive value for the feasibility in humans because of its close similarity to human skin. METHODS: In order to use porcine skin in the context of the underlying tissues, the isolated porcine forelimb was chosen as an assay model for use with the INJEX injector. Ink or the fluorescent dye fluorescein-isothiocyanate was injected and the penetration depth was determined metrically and dye distribution histologically. To assess the resorption of heparin, needle injection was compared with needle-free injection in a perfused limb model. RESULTS: Increasing amounts of ink increasingly penetrated into subcutaneous tissue layers in a cone-shaped manner mainly following lead structures. Penetration was hampered by skin thickness and by the deep muscle fascia, which served as a penetration barrier. Resorption of heparin was similar irrespective of injection by the use of a needle or the INJEX device. CONCLUSIONS: The isolated porcine forelimb serves as a versatile tool for the assessment of the biological performance of needle-free injection devices such as INJEX. Further studies are necessary to correlate the model for drug delivery in humans.},

abstract = {A new needleless jet-injector, Mini-Imojet{\textregistered}, was developed that administers liquid vaccines from a single-use, pre-filled cartridge named Imule{\textregistered}, which avoids the risk of cross-contamination. We conducted clinical trials in several settings in France and West Africa to compare the immunogenicity and tolerance of five vaccines (influenza vaccine, Vi capsular polysaccharide typhoid vaccine, tetanus toxoid vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine, and inactivated hepatitis A vaccine) administered with the Imule{\textregistered} system vs standard syringe technique. In each vaccine study, all subjects of either group were tested for serum antibody titres to calculate the geometrical mean titres and seroconversion rates after complete vaccination. Immediate local reactions were noted after each injection, and local and general reactions were evaluated during a predetermined period of follow-up. When delivered by the Imule{\textregistered} technique, all the administered vaccines were of equivalent or superior immunogenicity, compared to the syringe technique. The tolerance to vaccines injected by the Imule{\textregistered} system was acceptable in all studies. The most frequently observed reactions were mild (e.g. minor bleeding, superficial papules, erythema and induration) and could be considered to be inherent to the injection technique. The technical and safety advantages of the Mini-Imojet{\textregistered}/Imule{\textregistered} system, compared to sterilizable, standard disposable or autodestruct syringes and to classical multi-dose vial jet-injectors, reinforces the interest of this new injection technique for collective immunizations.},

abstract = {Livestock producers and their employees sometimes experience unintentional needlestick injury (NSI) while vaccinating or injecting medications into animals. There is little published regarding the medical complications that can develop from this occupational exposure. The objectives of this study were to (1) perform a retrospective review of animal-related NSIs treated at a tertiary medical center of a rural state; and (2) review the risks of NSI and measures to decrease their occurrence. Medical records of patients with NSI related to animal injection were identified from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics database from 2002 to 2008 and reviewed. Nine patients received medical care for NSI that occurred while vaccinating farm animals. Most common NSI site was the nondominant hand and most occurred while attempting to inject the animal. Soft tissue infection was common and all nine received oral and/or intravenous antibiotics. Two thirds required hospital admission. Three required surgery and one had a bedside incision and drainage procedure. One patient had a serious inflammatory reaction with necrosis in the leg due to the oil adjuvant in the animal vaccine. Another case had a probable mycetoma with osteomyelitis and soft tissue infection due to the bacteria Streptomyces, which is a NSI complication not previously reported. Although medical complications from farm-related NSIs do not appear to be common, this case series illustrates how these injuries can be debilitating, costly, and lead to loss of work time and productivity. Producers and employees who inject livestock need to be aware of the risks and utilize measures to decrease unintentional NSI.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Pressure-driven jets have been used for intradermal delivery of a variety of drugs. Despite their introduction into clinical medicine, variability and occasional bruising have limited their widespread acceptance. Although numerous clinical studies of jet injectors have been reported in the literature, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms of jet penetration into the skin. In this article, we report results of our studies aimed at determining the dependence of drug delivery on jet velocity and diameter. These studies were performed using two experimental models, porcine skin and human skin. Our rationale for using two models was to explore the possibility of using porcine skin as a model for human skin. METHODS: Dermal penetration of jets possessing a range of diameters from 76 microm to 559 microm and a range of velocities from 80 m/s to 190 m/s was studied into human and porcine skin. Penetration was quantified using radiolabeled mannitol. Pressure and velocity of the jets were measured using a calibrated pressure transducer and high-speed photography. RESULTS: Penetration of the jet into the skin was determined by two main parameters, jet diameter and average jet velocity. Substantial variation in jet penetration into porcine skin was observed for skin pieces obtained from different anatomic locations. For porcine skin, a parabolic dependence of jet delivery on velocity and diameter was observed. The threshold velocity is suggested to be between 80 and 100 m/s for a jet diameter of 152 microm. Above the threshold velocity, the delivery increased for velocities up to 150 m/s, after which delivery decreased with increasing velocity. At a constant velocity of 150 m/s, jet delivery exhibited a maximum at a diameter of 152 microm. Results obtained with human skin were qualitatively similar but quantitatively different. The threshold velocity for jet penetration into human skin was comparable with that in porcine skin; however, the maxima observed in jet delivery into porcine skin with respect to jet velocity was not apparent for human skin over the range of velocities explored. CONCLUSIONS: These studies offer a quantitative analysis of jet penetration into the skin.},

abstract = {Jet injection is a needle-free drug delivery method in which a high-speed stream of fluid impacts the skin and delivers drugs. Although a number of jet injectors are commercially available, especially for insulin delivery, a quantitative understanding of the energetics of jet injection is still lacking. Here, we describe the dependence of jet injections into human skin on the power of the jet. Dermal delivery of liquid jets was quantified using two measurements, penetration of a radiolabeled solute, mannitol, into skin and the shape of jet dispersion in the skin which was visualized using sulforhodamine B (SRB). The power of the jet at the nozzle was varied from 1 to 600 W by independently altering the nozzle diameter (30-560 ??m) and jet velocity (100-200 m/s). The dependence of the amount of liquid delivered in the skin and the geometric measurements of jet dispersion on nozzle diameter and jet velocity was captured by a single parameter, jet power. Additional experiments were performed using a model material, polyacrylamide gel, to further understand the dependence of jet penetration on jet power. These experiments demonstrated that jet power also effectively describes gel erosion due to liquid impingement. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Meanwhile, the performances of these motors highly depend on the material and manufacturing parameters besides structure parameters. Therefore, we present a robust design optimization method for high quality manufacturing of these PM-SMC motors to improve their industrial applications.

abstract = {This paper presents an approach for improving the process of optimal design of permanent-magnet (PM) motors. A finite-element method (FEM) combined with a dynamic dual-response-surface model (dual-RSM) is proposed to compute an objective function. The FEM is employed as a basic tool for the computation of the objective function. In order to build up the dual-RSM model, a radial basis function and a moving least-square approximation are both employed. The results that are obtained from the dual-RSM model are dynamically compared together with a preset goodness-of-fit, which determines whether the accuracies of the dual-RSM are high enough to replace the FEM computation. This strategy makes the FEM computation not always necessary at all the sample points in the optimization process and ensures the accuracy of the solution. For the purpose of showing the effectiveness of the proposed optimization methodology, the optimal design process of a dual PM-excited synchronous motor is taken as an example in this paper.},

Then, the results of the individual parameter optimizations are examined by a global optimization with genetic algorithm. Furthermore, the magnet thickness of all the machines and the middle teeth of the E-core machines are analyzed individually. Finally, the electromagnetic performance of the novel machines are analyzed and compared with the conventional machine. It shows that both E-core and C-core machines require significantly smaller magnet volume since only about half the number of permanent magnets is required. Furthermore, the C-core machines have the largest back-EMF and force density due to the largest slot area, and the E-core machines are suitable for fault-tolerant operations while the 6/11 mover/stator pole E-core SFPM machine has the smallest cogging force.},

abstract = {In this article, characterization and compensation for the friction at the micro (plastic module and nonlinear spring) and macro modes (nonlinear Coulomb and Stribeck) of a linear-motor rolling-guide stage are reported. Because the system dynamics under the micro and macro modes are very different, the paradox to determine the optimal servo gains for both modes was solved by a two-stage fuzzy PID controller. The fuzzy PID controller possesses a switching mechanism that continuously tunes the servo gains according to the system states. For the precision reversal path tracking at low speed, the system dynamics is dominated by the complicated and nonlinear friction characteristics. Due to the nonlinear spring characteristics, the friction was found unsymmetrical at the reversal points of the low speed path tracking. A simplified unsymmetrical friction model was proposed and proved to improved motion precision well. From the simulations and experiments, the proposed controller shows good tracking and positioning accuracy after friction compensation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The objective of the optimization is to reduce the motor weight while maximizing the thrust force as well as minimizing the detent force of the motor. The stator pole length, the air gap length, the winding window width, and the stator pole width define the search space for the optimization problem. Response surface methodology (RSM) is well adapted to obtain an analytical model of the motor weight, detent force, and thrust force.

abstract = {Although tubular permanent-magnet motors have advantages such as remarkable force capability and high efficiency due to lack of end winding, they suffer from high thrust force ripple. This paper presents the use of Taguchi method and artificial neural network (ANN) for shape optimization of axially magnetized tubular linear permanent-magnet (TLPM) motors. A multiobjective design optimization is presented to improve force ripple, developed thrust, and permanent-magnet volume simultaneously. The iron pole-piece slotting technique is used and its design parameters are optimized to minimize the motor's force pulsation. To obtain optimal configuration using this technique, four design variables are selected and their approximate optimum values are determined by the Taguchi method using analysis of means (ANOM). In the next step, two more influential parameters are selected by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and their accurate optimum values are obtained by a trained ANN. Finite-element analysis (FEA) is used to appraise the performance of the motor in different experiments of the Taguchi method and for training the ANN. The results show that force pulsation of the optimized motor is greatly reduced while there is small drop in the motor thrust.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study on high-efficiency performance in an interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) with a constant amount of PM. Based on a provided conventional single-layer IPMSM, a double-layer IPM rotor design is proposed for improving motor efficiency performance under the same output torque performance. With the help of an introduced optimization approach, the design of experiment, combined with the response surface methodology, an optimum design of the double-layer IPMSM model, is determined efficiently. In the study, the main emphasis is placed on revealing the merits of double-layer IPM rotor design that benefit the torque characteristic and motor efficiency performance. The equivalent circuit method, coupled with the finite-element method, is used in the study for calculating the machine parameters and analyzing motor performances, and the experiment results are also given to confirm the proposed approach.},
